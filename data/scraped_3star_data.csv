3/18/2023,Worked fine for a few months… not the SmartCast home page takes a long time to load if it does at all without having to be restarted. It doesnt always play apps and has to reboot often.

1/28/2022,"This would be a fantastic TV except for some bothersome problems. There are a multitude of lime green lines of various lengths extending from the top of the screen all the time. Most of the time but not always, there is a 5"" transparent bar going across the bottom of the screen from left to right. The TV was okay for the first 2 days I had it but these problems have escalated as the days go by. I've had it for a week, so not a lot of days. I'll be calling Vizio today for help. If that doesn't work, I'll have to call Walmart. My husband has already burned the box, and I have a sinking feeling this will be an issue. So disappointed...",3 out of 5 stars review
2/12/2023,"So far so good. It starts up easily enough. However, the Smartcast Operating System bloats the menu with dozens and dozens of proprientary and partnership apps that seem to slow down performance greatly. Apps that our family has zero intention of ever using. Vizio attempts a 'slight-of-hand' claim that ""everything is managed online"" and this glut of data isn't kept on the TV. But all THAT means is that this slowdown is eminating from the TV drawing down more unneccasary data whenever it's being used, choking at the speed of our internet service. For those of you who don't know this;  such bloatware is how products like pre-installed laptops and this Vizio TV are delivered to the market at scale for rock bottom prices. They compensate the ac...",3 out of 5 stars review

Pros: Good quality screen. Brand is known for good. Voice control and phone app for control. Price was convenient for a 50"" tv.

Cons: 
- can't browse in internet as Samsung smart does
- apps are restricted and limited to few, Samsung allows to download: freevee, kanopy, ROKU tv and so much more! this is the main reason why I returned it.",3 out of 5 stars review

1/31/2024,The first day using this TV there was almost immediate screen burn in - the NFL logo after watching a game. It slowly faded but I'm nervous about leaving certain shows or channels with a logo on for too long.

As far as function goes It has a clean home screen, works fairly well, but I had issues keeping my Vizio brand soundbar connected for about 6 months until a update was released to fix the issue.

1/3/2024,"First, the remote horrible! No HULU, short cut.  The volume buttons are on the side and the up and down are too close together to discern between the two. The color goes in and out which I also don't like. I have  always loved the speakers on Vizio TV's and this one also has great speakers. The last thing that I don't like is my old Vizio had the Vizio name at the bottom of the screen, and would lite up when you turned it on. This new one does not. In my opinion, this doesn't make Vizio stand out from other TV's. The little blue light at the bottom right is horrible and sad looking. It does nothing for me.",3 out of 5 stars review

Vizio uses screencast as their homescreen and it is absolute garbage. it freezes. the apps wont load. the shows will lag and freeze. we are instead just using the firestick for our streaming services. i wouldnt buy again and i woulsnt recommend.",3 out of 5 stars review

It also has an on screen channel selector when using the rabbit ears, no numbers on the controller pad, no issue if using with cable provider.

At first I though it was the remote control that had problems then notice there was a delay from the TV to bring up the picture and even changing channels. I rebooted the TV several times and some times it speed up and other times it didn't. The free channels VIZIO provides even takes longer to come up. I see now why there are reviews of people complaining about the remote control not working. Great price and picture but the TV functionality is not great.,3 out of 5 stars review

Several times a week I have to restart because it gets hung up or remote goes crazy and just keeps flipping through options without ability to choose one and get on with it. Maybe other models are good but this one clearly has bugs.,3 out of 5 stars review
1/20/2022,"Easy to buy, delivered this 65"" to my home. USB does not play movies like my previous VIZIO from 2 years ago. Then the system froze while in the via online mode and finally, the HDMI sound stopped working. Returned it and bought the 70"" instead... so far it seems to be a bit smarter.",3 out of 5 stars review
1/14/2022,Picture quality is good but I am highly disappointed that Vizio took it upon themselves 2 dictate app usage. My preferred live streaming app is Slingtv. I am pondering sending the TV back for this reason alone. the live TV apps that are installed keeps freezing when trying to review and I am certain it has nothing to do with my Wi-Fi connection as Sling TV runs smoothly on all other devices in the household. Vizio has always been a trusted brand in my household. Companies fail to realize that they lose consumers when trying to keep up with the Joneses and try to fix something that wasn't broken! My Smart TV is a dumb one!,3 out of 5 stars review

4/5/2022,The Vizio is nice... great picture quality and overall a good value. It's light and doesn't strain your arms to wall mount The only issue I have really is that the RCA jacks for audio on the back do. Or emit sound when I plug into a receiver for movies. I've used the same receiver for all other TV's I. My home with no issues.,3 out of 5 stars review
2/4/2024,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've never had issues with Vizio TV's until this one. While the quality is very good, its very disappointing that the support for apps is abysmal. Apps keep crashing on me and rebooting the TV on its own.

1/6/2024,"This TV has a beautiful picture, an easy and simple to navigate menu, and tons of built in apps. The reason I'm docking it two stars is for a flaw in the audio that, according to social media, lots of other Vizio owners have been complaining about. It's almost as if there's some sort of sound gate built into this TV that can't be adjusted or turned off. During quiet scenes in movies, video games or TV, it's almost like the sound momentarily shuts off, and entire words of dialogue are missed. It's an extremely irritating flaw that I've tried countless ""solutions"" I've found online to no avail. It's a shame because again it's got a very nice picture, but it takes you out of a good movie or game when the sound keeps cutting out.",3 out of 5 stars review

No, we do not have any access to internet except through our phone hotspots. Not willing to pay for that when we already pay for unlimited on our plan.

I bought a “D-series” 32” Vizio a few months back that was just PLAGUED with issues, and I returned it pretty quickly. 

I purchased this 50” Vizio 4k V-Series thinking it’d be fine, maybe I just bought a budget model. Well… I’m not sure.

Crunchyroll bought Funimation, and all the Funimation content is porting to Crunchyroll and yet the Vizio system still hasn't caught on. And Hoopla is part of the public library system, and it seems Vizio doesn't care to support them.

I have a Harmony remote and if the Vizio turns on before the input device it gets stuck until I turn off the tv and turn it back on again. Real pain. Now I have to reprogram the remote so the tv is last to turn on. That’s a defective design. The picture quality out of the box was horrible. Had to bump up the sharpness quite a bit and turn down brightness - that’s a factory setting that should have been better out of the box. Also does not seem to be a way to save these tweaks so I’ll have to reset these if the not so smart tv loses its memory…. Miss my plasma, much better picture quality.",3 out of 5 stars review

6/28/2022,I want to start off by saying that this is my first Vizio TV. I’d connected it to my Alexa once and I moved and now it’s not connecting. I also brought it for the 4K and I can’t tell if it’s 4K or not the picture quality is alright overall not bad for the price.  I guess you get what you paid for.,3 out of 5 stars review

6/28/2022,"I PURCHASED THE 70"" VIZIO TV LESS THAN A MONTH.   FOR THE MOST PART ALL IS GOOD EXCEPT TWO ISSUES.  ONE IS MINOR,  IT IS SLOW TO POPULATE THE SCRENN WHEN I AM TURNING IT ON AND THE SECOND IS MORE MAJOR, THE SOUND IS POOR QUALITY.   I MUST ADJUST THE SOUND UPWARD AND THE VOLUME IS FUTTER UP AND DOWN A LITTLE.  BUT I DO LIKE IT.",3 out of 5 stars review
5/31/2022,"The tv itself functions as it should, and is very simple to use as far as the smart component goes. I just wish that VIZIO had the good sense to allow an option for external app developers and a basic internet browser.

12/29/2022,"Rec'd a 43” Vizio V435-J01 for Christmas. Once all hooked up, colors looked very washed out. I spent 2 days adjusting(with instructions from manual). I'm about 75% there as far as colors go. But there are two problems: my menus do not have the Picture Mode Edit feature to Save my changes! Also, the overall picture is not that sharp. I've tried everything the manual suggests and picture quality is still very disappointing. I've had a Vizio 32” for years that I was very happy with so don't know if I should exchange my new TV for another one or just return this one and buy another brand.

2/11/2022,"I bought this TV without looking over any details. First of all it does not have a USB port witch sucks because you can't pause the TV like a roku TV. And right off the bat I encountered these problems: For some reason the sound stops sometimes on  just a few select channels and sometimes on all of them or the picture will be all green or black out, and you must unplug the TV and plug it back in, that resets it and it works just fine. other than that. the TV is wounderful I just hate putting up with having to unplug it once in a while in order to reset the sound or the picture. It took me a while to figure out that all I had to do was unplug it for it to work again. I didn't want to take it back, it is huge and since I hade to have someone ...",3 out of 5 stars review
5/24/2022,"I bought the 65in 4k V Series about a month ago. It's an over all good value. The pros are 1 Good picture quality 2 Good price point 3 Good sound for a HDTV, which generally have notoriously bad sound quality. The Cons 1 No over the air channel guide, this is a really good feature that this tv does not support. 2 No Bluetooth connectivity for external speakers. 3 Has compatibility issue with Klipsch soundbars, I had to replace a very expensive soundbar because my Klipsh was not supported.",3 out of 5 stars review
8/19/2021,"I love the picture and sound. It functions beautifully. I wish I was able to download the apps that I want though.  Instead I have to use a separate device to basically Chromecast half the apps I use. If I wanted to handle 2 devices as a remote, I would have just hooked up another roku. As limited as roku is, I was able to install all apps I subscribe to for streaming. I'm temtpted to do so still and just use the tv for picture and sound.",3 out of 5 stars review
2/18/2022,I love Vizio TV's but this purchase has been a problem.  I am having network issues and Vizio sent a tech out but instead of replacing the network board he replaced the main board.  So far the issues are still the same. When I use a Roku device the network issues go away.  I am thinking about returning it and getting a replacement to see if that helps.,3 out of 5 stars review
7/8/2022,I currently have Amazon Prime Video which allows access to Paramount+ on my other TVs and devices but not on this TV.  I tried several times to access Paramount+ through Prime Video without success.  I contacted Prime Video and they say that Paramount+ can not be accessed through Prime because Vizio is not compatible with Paramount+.  I am however able to access it if I want to start a brand new subscription through Paramount+ which I find ridiculous as I already have a subscription.  Also it would be my suggestion you might consider a sound bar because if you are sitting in front of the set the volume is hard to hear but if you are behind it the volume is LOUD.,3 out of 5 stars review

I wish I would have invested a bit more for a better quality TV.",3 out of 5 stars review
5/19/2022,I really like the TV the pictures great you know it has very nice colors and all. The one thing I don’t like is the fact that you know the remote doesn’t have any numbers so you have to figure out how to change the channels and if there’s no guide there’s nothing that tells you what is coming on or what is currently playing I don’t care for that. Had I known that I probably wouldn’t have bought this particular TV but for the most part it’s a good TV,3 out of 5 stars review

9/25/2022,Not sure if it’s cause Im used to Roku but I don’t like this tv. I can’t find new apps that aren’t already loaded. I’m not able to even stream with my carrier. I’m sending this back if I can and look for something that has real apps and not these off the wall apps preloaded. If you’re used to having Spectrum just know you can’t add that app. Just not happy with this product. Well I just found out that I can’t return it so I guess I’ll find someone who wants a piece of junk tv. See the apps before you buy and not get stuck with this tv.,3 out of 5 stars review
2/5/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Got this as Christmas and Birthday gifts. I love bigger TV and included Smart Apps.

12/8/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a pretty good product.  It takes some getting used to, and some features are less than ideal.  When using HDMI with a PS5, for example, it has to be plugged into port 1... plugging into port 3 and pressing the PS button for some reason causes it to switch to port 1.  Another feature that's decent but annoying at the same time is how the TV handles apps.  I like that I don't need to download specific apps for my TV, but at the same time, I would like apps not currently available on this TV without buying another product or using Apple/Chromecast.  It does get the job done, albeit with these caveats.",3 out of 5 stars review
