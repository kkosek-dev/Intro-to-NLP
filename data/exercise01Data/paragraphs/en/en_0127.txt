During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic and fight against misinformation received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall.[258][259][260][261] Noam Cohen wrote in Wired that Wikipedia's effort to combat misinformation related to the pandemic was different from other major websites, opining, "Unless Twitter, Facebook and the others can learn to address misinformation more effectively, Wikipedia will remain the last best place on the Internet."[259] In October 2020, the World Health Organization announced they were freely licensing its infographics and other materials on Wikimedia projects.[262] There were nearly 7,000 COVID-19 related Wikipedia articles across 188 different Wikipedias, as of NovemberÂ 2021.[update][263][264]
