In May 2018, a Wikipedia editor rejected a submitted article about Donna Strickland due to lack of coverage in the media.[W 65][202] Five months later, Strickland won a Nobel Prize in Physics "for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics", becoming the third woman to ever receive the award.[202][203] Prior to winning the award, Strickland's only mention on Wikipedia was in the article about her collaborator and co-winner of the award GÃ©rard Mourou.[202] Her exclusion from Wikipedia led to accusations of sexism, but Corinne Purtill writing for Quartz argued that "it's also a pointed lesson in the hazards of gender bias in media, and of the broader consequences of underrepresentation."[204] Purtill attributes the issue to the gender bias in media coverage.[204]
