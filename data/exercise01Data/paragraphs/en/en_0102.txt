Following growing amounts of incoming donations in 2013 exceeding seven digits,[37] the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.[222] Two projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and the "Thank" tab in the edit history, which were developed to improve issues of editor attrition.[37][214] The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.[223] At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars,[W 91] the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually.[223] In 2019, the level of contributions were reported by the Wikimedia Foundation as being at $120 million annually,[W 92] updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually.[223]
