Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as "an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language".[W 51] Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).[W 52] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[W 53] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.[W 54] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics.[W 54] It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.[W 34]
