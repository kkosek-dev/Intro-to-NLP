Academic studies of Wikipedia have consistently shown that Wikipedia systematically over-represents a point of view (POV) belonging to a particular demographic described as the "average Wikipedian", who is an educated, technically inclined, English speaking white male, aged 15â€“49 from a developed Christian country in the northern hemisphere.[181] This POV is over-represented in relation to all existing POVs.[182][183] This systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias, gender bias, and geographical bias on Wikipedia.[184][185] There are two broad types of bias, which are implicit (when a topic is omitted) and explicit (when a certain POV is over-represented in an article or by references).[182]
