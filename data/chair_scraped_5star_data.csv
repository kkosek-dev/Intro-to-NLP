11/19/2023,It‚Äôs super soft and good quality! I can‚Äôt wait to sleep on it. I just got it. I‚Äôm going to let it air out and stuff for about 2-3 days and see if it expands more from being air tight. There‚Äôs a small smell but it‚Äôs not anything unbearable or terrible smelling.

8/25/2023,"This 12‚Äù twin mattress is a second mattress from Zinus I bought. First one was queen size mattress passed the test of two years hard use (two overweight people) with excellent grade.no smell when unpacking, preservation of the original shape after two years, comfortable and soft, this criteria satisfied us. Will definitely buy again, and recommend to anyone.",5 out of 5 stars review
9/30/2023,I love this bed! I used it for 7 years and when it wore out I thought I wanted something different so I bought a pillow top mattress but after 60 days of the pillow top no doubt I went back and purchased another one of these.

1/20/2024,"I give 5 stars because if it was 6 inches, (its 5) it would be perfect in every way. Comfortable and soft and durable. The fabric on it is a tad loose, but that may be because it didn't inflate to 6 in.",5 out of 5 stars review
10/25/2023,I bought the 8 inch as we already have a pretty tall frame and box spring! This bed is comfy and but pretty soft! No smell to the mattress and expanded within seconds of cutting the package. The box is not the long awkward box and is easy to carry.,5 out of 5 stars review
2/20/2017,I needed a new mattress and had decided I was going to buy a Memory Foam.  I was researching all the online brands because I wanted one that was delivered to my home.  I was almost ready to purchase a Cocoon mattress based on price and construction.  I was purchasing groceries on Walmart.com and decided to look at the bedding and linen section actually looking for something else.  I stumbled upon this memory foam mattress and was stunned they even carried mattresses.  I started reading reviews and they were all for the most part very positive.  I read tons and looked at pictures.  I went back and reviewed the construction of all the other more named brand memory foam mattresses and then the construction of this brand.  I realized it was ver...,5 out of 5 stars review
1/17/2021,"I bought this bed back in March 2020 and I waited to write a review because I wanted to at least experience it for 6mths. The bed is amazing for the price and extremely comfortable. I‚Äôve had family come over and sleep in my bedroom and have raved about my mattress. My mom bought a temperpedic and exchange it for this mattress. There was no smell as mentioned in previous reviews, it inflated almost immediately and within 24 hours we were sleeping on the mattress. It is heavy and definitely a two person move but you won‚Äôt regret it",5 out of 5 stars review
8/3/2021,"Shipping was great. Right on time. I read other reviews that said it was heavy so I was prepared. I pulled the box up to my door and opened it. I laid it on its side and pulled the rolled up mattress out and onto an old blanket.  Pulled the mattress to the bedroom. As soon as I began unrolling the plastic, I could hear the mattress breathing. Once its unrolled, you will see its folded in two and enclosed in another piece of plastic. As soon as I cut the plastic, the mattress started rising. Before I could cut away most of the plastic, it was nearly the full size. Its absolutely beautiful. My guest room is perfect now.",5 out of 5 stars review
7/28/2020,We just bought the king size. Now I was worried about buying this since this was half the price and 2 sizes bigger than our ola mattress which was only 3 years old but already started to feel uncomfortable. But this product was amazing.. It fluffed right up and no bad smells at all. When u get on it u melt like butter into the matress. Its not to soft or to firm. Me and my husband love it. Don't hesitate buying this you will be very pleased. The price is unbelievable........ I'm very pleased.. Hope this helps someone on buying this without any hesitation. Cause you won't regret it....,5 out of 5 stars review

2/3/2021,"I absolutely love this mattress! It is perfect for my back, since most mattresses cause a major arch in my lower back that hurts when I'm lying on my stomach. Also, I'm using this mattress on a platform bed that only comes with wooden slats, no box spring and it has so much support! It expanded well and it wasn't too difficult to cut out of the vacuum sealed bag. I did allow my mattress to sit several days, about 5, before sleeping on it. This was a great buy and I'm very satisfied.",5 out of 5 stars review
12/6/2010,I ordered the Sensations Memory Foam after reading the rave reviews. The mattress arrived after 8 days using the free site to store shipping option. The mattress comes packed in a box inside that is a bag (like a tent bag) then they wrap the mattress in plastic (rolled up). The associate loaded into my vehicle with some frustration at it weighing 150lbs. I suggest taking a friend with you to S2S. At home my husband unloaded the box grumbling about never seeing a real mattress packed in such a way. He was not keen on my purchase but I'm the savvy shopper here. He opened the box in the living room so it wouldn't be in the way unrolling the bed or pancake as he called it. He brought the bag to our bedroom and ripped down the seam.

When I took it out of the box it plumped up really quickly.  I didn‚Äôt even have to wait overnight.   I have had 2 back surgeries so I‚Äôm very picky about my mattresses.  This is top quality.

Perfect for me!",5 out of 5 stars review

6/21/2018,"Mattress inflated fully IMMEDIATELY! It's a full 12 inches as well. A few years ago I slept on a friends' memory foam mattress and it was like sleeping on a slab of concrete so I was nervous about buying one. Um, YOU SHOULDN'T BE THOUGH! This is like sleeping on a cloud. Perfect for all kind of sleepers- back, side, stomach, you name it! My sister is constantly coming in my room and stretching out on it because it's so comfortable. Best mattress I've ever owned! 

The only bad thing about this was the off-gassing. It says to give it 48 hours to inflate all the way but really it needs more like 72 to let off all the smell(I gave it 48), inflating was not the issue at all. It wasn't a strong smell, but it did spread. I live in a small house b...",5 out of 5 stars review

3/13/2023,"This bed is firm, make no mistake about that.  I ordered and it arrived just three days later.  Packaged well in a cardboard box and then wrapped in heavy plastic wrap that you cut open and the bed then grows. I did wait 24 hours before sleeping on it. I purchased the 12 inch twin.   If you are looking for a firm bed, this is your boy. If you like something softer, don't even both with this one.  It is very supportive and does not sink down once you sit, lay on it.   I suggest you put it in the room where you want to use it, otherwise, it could get unruly having to haul it all over the house.  Mine was easy to move around, though, given that it is a twin.

12/20/2009,"This bed is awesome! First, I like to state that it comes with its own mattress cover, so that is a plus right there because for whatever reason if your mattress ever gets dirty (and it happens), you can just unzip it (it's a zippered cover) and throw it in the wash.

It's firm, but very soft too; I like it that it's foam, because I don't like spring mattresses. The quality is excellent - and the price is reasonable because unlike other mattresses, you wouldn't need to purchase a box spring, or a mattress set - this mattress is so thick it's meant to be used on it's own. It's very cushion-y; I am a 27 year old married woman with two kids and I was tempted to bounce on the bed when I got it!

6/23/2014,"I was quite skeptical about buying a mattress online. My old memory foam mattress (a low-end one from a furniture store) had to go after 8 years of use, but I didn't want to drop $1,000 on a new one. After reading the reviews, I felt like this was a pretty good gamble. My two primary concerns based on customer feedback was that it wouldn't inflate properly and that it would be too firm. Turns out I worried for nothing! When my queen-size bed arrived (a day early), we immediately opened it up and placed it on the Spa Sensations platform frame that I also ordered with it. As soon as air hit it the thing immediately inflated up to its full size (see photo that was taken just minutes after opening). There was a strong odor for a little while, b...",5 out of 5 stars review

If the date is a very old one, the mattress will not unfold and expand to the full 6"".  We ordered ours at the end of July.  When it arrived, the date on the box was January 2017.  We opened and let the mattress air out a few days, because it does have a mild chemical smell which will go away.  The mattress leans more towards the firm side than the soft side, but my son loves it.  The mattress appears to be of very high quality and I believe it will last for years, because it does not sink in as many of these type mattresses do.  And yes, it actually did expand to the full 6"" as shown in the picture.",5 out of 5 stars review

The odor that some reviews have mentioned was barely noticeable, and not even close to being offensive. Just a faint new product smell, like a car or new leather shoes.....It didn't quite inflate to 12"", but that was actually better for us. It's just a tad over 11"" high.

We were also interested in platform bed & didnt need a boxspring anyway.I'm 28 & have back problems (scoliosis), so I'm very picky about my bed. This bed conforms to the curves of your body with the right amount of softness. You do not sink in to much to where your back hurts in the morning, so it offers support at the same time. I used site to store & we had our bed within 5 days. Until I can afford a tempurpedic this bed is a great choice! I also ordered the curtis tufted bed in white for the perfect bed/mattress!",5 out of 5 stars review
8/7/2016,"I was looking for a mattress for my new room that would be easy to set up by myself. I'm a college student and my price range was way lower than what the other ""mattress in a box"" companies typically charge. I read most of the reviews and was basically sold.

The mattress was delivered one day earlier than I expected. It showed up in a huge box. The box was hard to get up the stairs but I managed to do it by myself. I just followed the instructions in the box and the bed inflated to almost full size within maybe 2 hours. It was amazing how quickly it happened.

I get the best sleep of my life in this bed. To me, this bed is soft. I typically prefer a more firm bed but it's supportive enough that I love it. It's amazing. I have no complaints...",5 out of 5 stars review

4/19/2011,"I bought this bed (along with a platform bed frame) back in February and I really love it! The mattress is unbelievably comfortable and just molds right to your body when you lay down. I got it initially because I wanted to get something for my lower back pain, for an injury I sustained a few years ago. I can lay down on the bed at night and feel so refreshed in the morning...it's been a great investment for me. If you're on the fence about whether or not you should buy, I say go for it. You won't be disappointed!",5 out of 5 stars review
6/6/2012,"My Fiance and I bought this bed (and the platform bed frame.) As a married couple we knew we would need a bed that was comfortable, affordable, and big enough for us each to stretch out when we sleep. My Mother-in-law suggested that we look at this mattress because she had purchased it to keep at her daughters house. She has arthritis (I have arthritis as well) and when she stayed with my sister-in-law she got very little sleep due to the uncomfortable guest room bed, the bed was also too small to comfortably fit her and my father-in-law. After she bought the bed and then visited my sister-in-law, she came home raving about how wonderful the bed was, how she thought it was much more comfortable than the mattress she has in her own home... a...",5 out of 5 stars review
3/6/2010,"We just received our foam mattress and I already love it. Compared to our old mattress full of springs this one is heaven.

It took less than a week to arrive to the store and as all the other reviews said, it came rolled up in a double box, heavy as h3ck. Good thing my airman has muscles. He put them to good use =))

Once we put it on the box springs the foam just rose up like a dough in less than 45 min. Right now it's about 10"". Hopefully, by tomorrow it reaches the promised 12"".

For the record: make sure you adjust it before it starts rising to full height. We made the mistake to move it around after it rose and boy that suck3r is heavy.

In the future we plan to buy a full and a queen for our two guest bedrooms.

Over all great produc...",5 out of 5 stars review
6/28/2009,"I purchased this for my guest room. This is my 3rd foam mattress, second Spa Sensation.

The positives are: it is extremely comfortable, and there was hardly any odor/smell. My first Spa Sensation took almost 4 weeks for the smell to go away, but comfort reigned and I bought another one. I was pleasantly surprise that there was no smell issues.

The negatives are: The mattress is guaranteed for only 5 years. I did not pick that up in the description. Also, it is very heavy, so putting sheets on the mattress is a project particulary since I'm using a bed frame, not a plain platform. I believe 10"" mattress is enough. 12"" is pushing the envelope.",5 out of 5 stars review

I followed the directions by positioning the mattress on the bed PRIOR to opening the white bag that it comes in. I then opened the white bag by using the pre-made cutaway on that bag, As I was opening it, the mattress came to life and by the time I had it laying flat on the platform, the mattress was already at 11"" all the way around. I unzipped the mattress protector to allow the mattress to breathe a bit more freely and gave it 24 hours. There was a slight ""new"" smell as everyone had mentioned before, s...",5 out of 5 stars review

I then clicked on Memory Foam to see the different memory foam companies and how they rated. Spa Sensations was rated as top contender, even better than Tempur-pedic @ a fraction of the cost!

I was sold!

I have been sleeping on this mattress for a month now it is a little stiffer than my parents 13 inch ""Celebrity"" made by Tempur-pedic. I was expecting that because mine is only 6 inches thick.

11/9/2011,"Tips:
1. Use loose sheets or ‚ÄúJersey‚Äù sheets so the bed can breathe and be responsive.
2. Unzip the cover when you‚Äôre letting it inflate. It allows it to inflate better.
3. Bring someone to help you get this into your car.

I went with 12"" to avoid any of the problems expressed in other reviews for a 6"" mattress. 12"" gives the perfect height for a bed too. It was worth the extra money.",5 out of 5 stars review

8/9/2020,"Great mattress! very supportive! BEST PURCHASE EVER!! MONEY WELL SPENT!Does not sag or become flacid over time. For some reason this mattress becomes even more supportive when you put a fitted sheet on. So if you feel like you're 'sinking' PUT A FITTED SHEET ON IT!  Here is the reason why:... heat will make this mattress feel a little more softer but it doesn't mean that its no good its just the chemistry of the foam that becomes softer with heat, whether it's from the environment or your own body. But when you put a fitted (100% cotton) sheet on it it will prevent the direct transfer of heat from your body to the mattress and keep the mattress cooler and more firm.

The mattress is 11"" instead of 12"" but I had planned for that. It only took a few hours before it was ready for sleep.  Others complained of a smell from their mattress.  I barely smelled it when I opened the box and didn't even notice it after 30 minutes.

Good, but slats shifted.  Added plywood on top of slats and secured the plywood to the slats. This provides a firm and stable base. 
I think the weight of the sleeper must be considered. The heavier the person the firmer the base; where as, a lighter person may not require the firmness.

We researched memory foam mattresses, and found this one that had many great reviews. We decided to give it a try, since we could return it if we didn't like it.
The shipping was fast and the setup was easy, although a little unconventional. We couldn't beleive the comfort and quality of this mattres. I replaced a three year old mattress that was 5 times the price of this one and I can't believe a mattress this good, could cost so little.

I wanted to use it for a little while before reviewing and I can say I‚Äôm really happy with the purchase. It‚Äôs soft yet gives good support and it was so nice that it had very minimal odor when we unwrapped it. Typically whenever we get a new foam anything, they smell really bad. This one did not. Usually my husband is very sensitive to any chemical odors and we were concerned he wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep on it for a few days. Thankfully that was not the case with this one. He slept well on it the same night. It‚Äôs great. Do not hesitate to buy. The price is amazing. I also bought a waterproof mattress protector from ...",5 out of 5 stars review

1/24/2017,"We like this mattress very much.  The top three inches are soft memory foam, so it's a little softer than we were expecting, but the foam under that is firmer- you don't sink in too far.
No pressure points; very comfortable.  
The odor - a rubber or plastic-like scent, was mild, and gone in 2 days. The bed expanded to 11"" high at first, but after a week was  12"". You can't beat the price!  Our son bought one 3 years ago and it's still great.",5 out of 5 stars review
3/13/2013,"I ordered this from Canada and picked it up in Blaine, Washington. All in, duty, etc. I saved a hundred and twenty five bucks over buying Wallmart Canada.

took the bed out of the cardboard box and it fit into the back seat. Won't fit with the box though
I could tell that as soon as I seen it. The box had taken a beating but the bed is wrapped really well and there was no damage. It weighs about 80 lbs give or take.

1/12/2013,"Despite the numerous positive reviews, I was skeptical about purchasing this mattress. As described by the others, it arrived in a large box, but a much smaller box than expected. As instructed, I removed the plastic cover and layed out the mattess for a few days so it would be able to expand to it's full size. Still, I didn't think this was possible and then imagined if it did expancd, it would squish up the moment I laid on it. Well, I was wrong on all counts. Somehow the mattress achieved t's full size and to me it's incredibly comfortable. Many have described it as a little on the firm side and it's definitely more firm than my old mattress, but somehow it is also very nice to lay on. Others spoke of some hideous chemical odor--well, th...",5 out of 5 stars review

After researching different brands of memory foam mattresses and the prices for them, I ended up on Walmart's website and looking at Spa Sensations mattresses.  I'll admit, I was very hesitant on purchasing because of the price.  I wondered why this queen memory foam, 12"" costs only $269.00, on rollback pricing.  I read the reviews and the reviews were great.  I bought and received last week via FedEx.  I have been sleeping so well at night.  I don't wake up with back pain like I did with my old mattress.

The quilted cover is perfect and beautiful. This mattress decompressed very quickly and the instructions said to go ahead and sleep on it before it had fully decompressed. It does need deep pocket sheets. There was odor at all, and I have a very sensitive sense of smell. I love this 12 inch Zinus mattress!! I would not recommend going with any other brand or a smaller thickness.",5 out of 5 stars review
7/11/2017,"Just received our new mattress today.
Easy peasy to setup right out of the box. Be sure you're in the room you intend on using this mattress as it is a little heavy.
The mattress expanded the instant we cut open the plastic bag and expanded to about 11 inches. We'll see if it reaches the full 12 inches within the next 48 hours as instructed in the directions.
There was NO odor indicated.
Tags on mattress cover state, do not remove cover, do not wash cover, only spot clean as needed.
We have purchased an encasement mattress cover to keep this mattress in pristine condition.

We put it on a guest bed at first to expand out for two days then put it on our bed. It has been very comfortable and soft. It feels like one we had tried at another store which cost $2,500.

We took a trip and stayed at a HoJo's hotel, the mattress there was different, it was a memory foam. We were both in shock at how GREAT we both slept that night. Up till then I never gave memory foam a serious thought, besides our old mattress was just fine (so I thought). When we got home we looked all over the internet for memory foam mattresses / prices.

Just try to take it back !!It is firm but not hard, and it doesn't bog up around you so we haven't slept hot, which was a concern. We did ship to store and picked it up. I would recommend this, and add the following.
Get the pkg. home and remove from shipping boxes, leaving in the box like it would be on a store shelf. It is very large and heavy so a small handtruck would have been useful.

It is still like brand new and is still the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on.  I have a very bad back and I never have a pain while sleeping anymore.   I bought this twin size for my daughter when we remodeled her bedroom about 2 weeks ago.  The twin is just as comfortable as my queen size mattress.

Its not an organic fancy mattress but was actually comfortable in 1 hour.  I never thought I would wake up pain free.  This is Amazing Walmart and so reasonable.

9/1/2014,I was real dubious about if this bed would work for me as I really loved my very old air bed...but it has been great. Turning over is a little hard but most of the time I am so comfortable that I don't have to turn over...no more tossing and turning! I have bad arthritis and a bad back...waiting for surgery so comfort was hard to find and so appreciated. With my old bed I could only lay on my right side as it hurt too much to lay on the left but now I can lay either way. My back still hurts but at least I can sleep.,5 out of 5 stars review

I can travel and test out mattresses but then I get to pay for delivery or bribe someone with a truck to help me out. I of course was scared to order this because I had never really even sat on a memory foam mattress and ordering a mattress without testing is a big deal. I am also a large person so was a bit scared that it wouldn't ""bounce back"" as well as a skinny person using it. First night, it was definitely different but I slept so good.

I feel like I'm sleeping on a cloud. Plus the price was great and it arrived a day early. Mine did rise to 12"" in no time and the smell is like a fresh paint smell but not too strong trust me I have a super sensitive nose! Now I'm going to replace my kids mattresses too. This mattress is great!",5 out of 5 stars review

2/23/2013,"We had been looking at this mattress for about 2 years on and off. We looked around at the mattress stores and assorted places, but they were always much more than we were willing to pay.
When you are raising a family, normally there are a lot of other things that need your attention more than a mattress. But this year we finally broke down and decided that we had to do something. We always woke up with pain and discomfort.
I would get on here and look at the reviews and although the majority were positive, I couldn't ignore the negatives. It did feel like a gamble.

2/23/2021,"Comfortable and plush, this mattress makes me want to sleep in just a little longer. The top layers are super soft and form to you while the base layer is thick and supportive. I‚Äôve had problems with my back for years and wasn‚Äôt sure if a plush mattress would work for me, but I have been very pleasantly surprised. It relieves pressure points and helps with my hip and shoulder trouble as well. I‚Äôm a side and back sleeper pretty much equally, and this mattress is suited for either. We‚Äôve had it for about a month now. It‚Äôs holding up well with over 400 lbs on it every night.

4/30/2013,"I read a lot of the reviews for this mattress before my back convinced me that nothing could be worse than what I was currently sleeping on. It was right, nothing could've been, but thankfully this mattress is super comfortable. I got it in the house and up where it goes all by myself (5'2, 140 lbs), so it's a manageable size to start and then it puffs up really well and quickly. It did have a slight smell but it wasn't off putting in the slightest to me. Overall, it was a really fast ship and very convenient to pick up and it's a really good product. I am totally satisfied.",5 out of 5 stars review
7/16/2015,"I was looking for the soft mushy bed and this wasn't quite what i expected. Although it wasn't what i expected, it is perfect. It doesn't really conform to the body much so if you're looking for the type that sucks you into the bed this isn't the one. With any bed i recommend you get a mattress protector so you don't void the warranty and it will make the bed last longer. The mattress protector may be preventing it from conforming to the body but if you don't use it then you run the risk of problems voiding the warranty. No odor problems after a couple hours.",5 out of 5 stars review
12/8/2012,"when this mattress first arrived in a box, i was a little taken back. when i opened it and unfolded it, i was initially ticked off as it was not even near 12"" high and all bent out of shape. i placed it on the bungy boards (king size platform bed). a few hours later i noticed it was fluffing up a bit. by the next morning, the mattress was a perfect square, all the corners had reshaped themselves and it was indeed 12"" high. the comfort of this mattress is exceptional, better than my old tempurpedic. the cooling layer doesn't work as well as the gel mattresses but for the money, i would take this mattress over those anyways. great value!",5 out of 5 stars review
11/25/2016,"I've been sleeping on this bed for about 4 months now.  I bought this to replace a 10 yr. old Sleep # bed.  I was hesitant to switch, but took the plunge and so glad I did.  I can't believe how much better I'm sleeping now.  I'll address some of the things I've noticed with this bed to try and help those on the fence about buying this mattress.

Bed inflation:  The bed probably wont expand to a full 12"". Mine didn't, but it's close and is very evenly expanded.  I don't sleep with a ruler so the little bit of difference isn't noticeable while sleeping on it.

Bed is too hard:  The only thing I can think of here is let's say the ""Princess and the Pea"".  I mean come on, seriously.  The bed isn't hard, it's just supportive.  The top layer of me...",5 out of 5 stars review

I checked out so many beds and the cost were through the roof and I  would have had to take a loan out to purchase a bed. This bed is cost effective!

2/26/2019,"SO COMFORTABLE!! We bought this bed since our last was old and I was super nervous buying a bed online, but I read tons of the reviews and was FINALLY convinced. I got the package and as soon as I opened the bag it was fully puffed up at 12in. I was having a terrible pinched nerve the last month and sinc having this bed for the last week it is completely gone. The only thing I would say about this bed is it has a smell. Pretty potent. I kept my windows open the whole day when I got it. I‚Äôve had it for a week and can still smell it. Hoping it‚Äôll go away soon.",5 out of 5 stars review
8/10/2020,Overall I think this bed is awesome!!! It was delivered on time and easy to take out of the box. The instructions say to wait 24-48 hours for the mattress to fully decompress but mine was done within a couple of hours. There was a faint smell that smelled like paint to me (which wasnt horrible) and the instructions do warn you of the smell and it even tells you the smell should subside within 24-48 hours after letting it air out. The mattress is pretty firm but very comfortable and molds to your body when you lay on it. I love it and recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and inexpensive memory foam mattress,5 out of 5 stars review

I spent days and hours researching mattresses to replace my 12 year old pillowtop Simmons Beautyrest. I was a bit nervous about switching to a memory foam mattress since I LOVE plush pillowtops. Well, I finally caved and couldn't resist such a LOW price offered at Wal-Mart and the unbeatable no hassle guarantee (which others offered too but they didn't offer mattresses at such a great freaking price). We received the mattress and let it expand for the day and slept on it the first night.

3/22/2017,"I purchased this mattress for my daughter after I bought a similar one for myself made by the same company several years ago.  It comes in a box and I was able to fit it in my Honda Accord to take it home.  After you release it from its plastic wrapping it takes a couple of hours to rise fully.  We got standard queen sheets and they fit perfectly.  This mattress is so much more comfortable than a typical inner spring mattress.  When I got mine several years ago, the back pain I had been having each morning when I woke up immediately went away.  I've never had a Temperpedic because of the cost, but I can't imagine it being any more comfortable than this mattress and the cost is so much better on this one.  Highly recommend!",5 out of 5 stars review

I'd recommend to anyone.  It's easily as comfortable as those far more expensive memory foam mattresses.",5 out of 5 stars review
7/25/2016,This bed is just as comfortable as our Sealy Tempurpedic  and so much cheaper! It arrived within the specified shipping time. It is a little heavy but my husband and I were able to carry it together. You should  air it out for several days with open windows because it does have a funny smell. It does go away though. We put it on an old boxspring and it works fine; it may be an inch longer but does not effect it in any way. I would consider this a medium-firm mattress. Would definitely get this brand again if we ever need another bed.,5 out of 5 stars review

2/7/2021,"Let me start this by saying, if you've never slept on a memory foam mattress, be sure this is what you want, it's a completely different experience.

This is SUCH a great mattress. It puffed right up immediately after opening, although we did wait 24 hours to sleep on it, and it firmed up more as the day went on.  The cover is nice and soft and sturdy as well. I've slept on it a few nights now, and my neck crick I always wake up with has disappeared.  Sleeping on it is definitely a luxurious experience. 

Again, if you've never slept on a memory foam mattress, there's a learning (and loving it) curve. If you move around a lot in your sleep, you will notice you can't really slide easily like you do on a regular mattress. You're in a bit of a...",5 out of 5 stars review
8/21/2012,"I purchased this mattress after a friend raved about it. Was a little unsure about buying it over the internet without testing it, but since it was so much cheaper than the usual brands, we decided to take a chance, as anything was bound to be better than the traditional mattress we had.

My husband and I have never slept better. I am a tummy sleeper and he is a side sleeper -- both of us can lie down and are in immediate comfortable positions. I find that I wake up in the same position, meaning that I'm not tossing and turning during the night. I'm also not pushing my husband to roll over, so that either means I'm in too deep of a sleep to hear him, or he's not snoring as much as before.

There is a mild plastic-y smell when you first unwr...",5 out of 5 stars review

The bed took about an hour to reach 11 inches and by 24 hours it had reached its full 12 inches on all sides. The smell was not awful at all as I had seen reviews say, I highly recommend letting airflow through the room or open a window to speed the process up though dont let it sit in a closed room.

The texture is soft to the touch and seems to welcome you into its total body comfort. Although it takes about 24-48 hours to air out completely, I was able to sleep soundly the first night.

I also did my research on the different types of memory foam materials that most of these new mattresses are made of. This mattress uses (Visco foam) as the first primary layer on the mattress. This foam uses your body heat to conform to your body's shape, that means if the mattress is in a cold room its going to feel very firm at first until it warms up to you body temperature then it will cradle every contour of your body.

1/10/2013,WOW!!! I've been wanting a memory foam mattress since I first slept on one 17 years ago. The only thing preventing me from doing so (previously) was the insanely high price.

12/27/2016,"I don't usually leave feedback on things but I had to on this. I paid $323 for a king mattress and just used my box springs. I CAN NOT say enough about this mattress. It is so comfortable. It's soft and firm at the same time. I was really not sure before I bought it because of the getting hot issue. First off I turn into a heater when I sleep. I'm never hot but I radiate heat. I have woke up a couple times hot but it's just like a hot flash. Nothing unbearable. Don't let that discourage you from buying.  I will NEVER NEVER NEVER buy another expensive mattress again.  It was easy to set up and raised to the full 12 inches in about 2 hours. I didn't sleep on it the first night just to let it raise, set and air out. I had no bad smell either. ...",5 out of 5 stars review
9/20/2014,"For the price, you can't beat it. I had an old queen mattress that started to have springs poke you. I was in a car accident and couldn't handle the old mattress poking me. I had back surgery and 2 weeks afterward I bought this mattress. I hope due to the fact I'm laying in it almost 24/7, it doesn't affect the integrity of it, but for now, its wonderful! I have alot of spinal problems but I dont wake up in any pain! You just melt into it! I didn't experience the ""smell"" issue or have any issues with it not rising to full size. I think that buying the 12inch is the best way to go. I lay in it alot and I feel supported. Reading customer reviews helped me make my choice so I hope this will be helpful!",5 out of 5 stars review

It's soft and clean. Light smell but its tolerable.

My back has been in knots and hurting so bad. I woke up this morning and it was all gone and I didnt want to get out of bed. It does have a little smell but it tells you it will.

I am comparing this to a Tempurpedic that I paid thousands of dollars for, and had to replace due to downsizing my living space. I needed a new smaller size, and wasn't looking to spend a bunch of money again. 
Easy to set up. No way near heavy as that thousand dollar competitor. And it expanded to it's full 12"" in under one hour. I highly recommend this product. I'm convinced that it is a quality mattress!",5 out of 5 stars review

I need this spa like comfort because I am currently 15 weeks pregnant and I woke up in pain everyday from my other bed. This bed hugs my every curve. The thickness is unmatched, I√¢¬Ä¬ôve never had a mattress this thick. I dont even need a box spring. I ordered a canopy frame to put it on, but I will post a picture without it for now.

11/23/2018,"I bought this mattress in a king size in January 2015 so now I think I can give a valid long term review. We have used every night since day of delivery. It came in a box and it rose up after a few hours. I don't remember any smells at all and it has held up much better than I expected. I have recently moved and had to adjust to a size of bed that is quite unusual since our bedroom is of a weird shape. We custom made our bed in between a queen and king size and, because we are both short people, we enjoyed and added a shorter width to our bed. I absolutely loved to have the option to do this without having to custom order a mattress also. We used a box cutter to cut this mattress after measuring to our new bed. When cutting it, the foam sti...",5 out of 5 stars review

We also replaced a queen mattress, and purchased a metal base for it because the twins were so comfortable. I appreciate the fact the boxes were compact and delivered to my door. They replaced decades old Macys boxspring/ innerspring sets on maple frames. After adding another 12 2‚Äù slats there is enough support to eliminate the need for a box spring. All our guests rave about comfort, whether back or side sleeper, and ask for information so they can order a mattress for themselves. The included cover on each is a bonus.",5 out of 5 stars review

Its firm and it fluffed up to the allropriate size, there wasnt any smell only if u stick your nose deep in it but nothing that really mattered. This is a full foam mattress its just firm enough but will need to be placed over a boxed spring mattress because if just placed over a bed with wood planks it will bed and u will fall thru. This bed is perfect for the price. I recommend to everyone",5 out of 5 stars review
12/21/2018,"I love this mattress. It was easy to set up. Fully puffed up in seconds, and no fowl smell.  Actually after reading all the reviews I was concerned about the weight. But the mattress isn't as heavy as some make it seem.
I'm familiar with memory foam mattresses, as I slept for ten years on a brand name Temperpedic. 
Had to down size my mattress when I moved, so had to buy another mattress. I looked at every memory foam mattress from high to low end budget. And dollar for dollar you will not find a better mattress. I will stack this mattress against that $2000.00 Tempurpedic any day.

7/29/2020,"Only writing this review because I know shopping for a mattress online is HARD. Ive purchased this brand before for a queen and loved it so I decided to give the king a try. So glad I did because I am so happy with my new bed. A couple things to note: the bed is on the softer side. If you need a firm mattress this one is not for you. I like my bed soft so this is perfect for me! (No more hip pain!) secondly, the mattress corners will inflate at different rates, just give it time!
Actually confused at the bad reviews showing the mattress not inflating all the way. Thinking sometimes they ship out duds? Very glad I didnt have this problem.",5 out of 5 stars review

I read the reviews and this mattress seemed to be what I was looking for. The best was the price for a King! I mean $289.00, you can't beat that. I was prepared for my shipment and what to expect. The mattress had the smell everyone was talking about, but it went away in a couple of day. Fresh sheets and comforter, no issues a week later. The mattress is soft and comfortable, even my kids love it!

Yes, there is only about 2 inches of actual memory foam and the rest is hi density foam, but the ratio must be okay because it is super comfortable and supports my 4 year old great. I have laid on it a few times with him and it is super supportive for me as well. I think the quality is great, regardless of how much actual memory foam is in the product. I think for the price, you can't beat the quality.",5 out of 5 stars review

After reading all of the positive reviews while looking for a Twin XL, I decided to take the chance on this. Also ordered the Spa Sensations steel base bed and it was super-easy to put up- no tools required.

The mattress and base came super-fast and luckily, the day my son was going to sleep over at his best friend's house. So I was able to set it up and surprise him. I kept waiting for him to come down after he went to bed and say something....but he didn't! I found out why...",5 out of 5 stars review

Very comfortable he says. I ordered the king, took help to get on bed. If u sit down on it you sink but, if u lay down it's a comfy firm lay. I have back trouble and hard time getting out of bed. I left the old mattress on my bed to give height, and it wasn't but 2 years old. I can easily get out of bed now. Only problem I have is rolling over.

7/3/2016,The 12 inch mattress is great. It sleeps as well as the more expensive icomfort that we have in the other room. It was delivered to the house which made it so convenient. After being placed on the bed frame it took only 2 hours to expand to 12 inch thickness. It did get firmer after sitting the recommended 48 hours. i read a lot of the reviews siting the odor. I did not smell anything that bothered me. Great bed. I will never buy my mattress from the furniture store again. We also purchased the adjustable bed frame to go with this mattress. Both items are wonderful.,5 out of 5 stars review

It is a warm mattress but that works out great for me because I am usually cold and that will never be a problem for me. This mattress can't be beat for comfort.,5 out of 5 stars review

I have found that I have to use a very small pilow (travel) for the normal size pillow seams to arch my head too high. I was concerned about not using a electric blanket to warm the bed before getting in, but just warming the room is sufficient and the bed heats up with your own body heat enough that no heating is required all night.

This mattress was so comfortable to my back, I traded his full size metal bed for my king size bed for that night. I would definitely recommend memory foam mattresses for anyone, especially those with any kind of orthopedic problems. I am looking into eventually upgrading my bed mattress for memory foam.",5 out of 5 stars review
3/24/2013,"I bought this mattress for my son who is autistic. He is very sensory oriented. He LOVES this mattress. He is also 6'2"" and he is only 14. This mattress fits him perfectly and he still has room to grow a little. He loves the way it feels, the way it conforms to his body, everything about it. He is sleeping better at night and waking up in the morning in a much better mood.",5 out of 5 stars review
10/27/2012,LOVE IT!!! We went from a waterbed to the memory foam and immediately had a comfortable night's sleep. It feels like you are alone in bed because you do not feel your partner moving at all. Complete comfort and a deep sleep because there are no pressure points and no hands falling asleep.... therefore no need to be constantly changing position. Will not go back to a regular mattress or water mattress again. Why didn't we do this sooner?,5 out of 5 stars review

Mattress expanded to 11.5""; slight odor totally dissipated within 48 hrs; Mattress provides firm support yet is not hard - very comfortable.

I've been sleeping on this bed for over a week. I find it very comfortable! Maybe the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on! It's supportive, doesn't bounce around when I move, and I don't wake up with numbness in my hips or shoulders like I did with my old spring mattress.

No box springs necessary with the Spa Sensations platform bed frame! This is the least expensive bed I have ever owned and I couldn't be happier!",5 out of 5 stars review

6/5/2014,"I fell so special sleeping on this comfy mattress. It expanded to 5 1/2 inches immediately and full size after one day. I slept on it right away. I had to adjust to my new mattress for a couple days, feeling stiff the first few. Find that I sleep really comfortably on my back too now. I no longer need the 5 pillows that I used to use.

The mattress being just 6 inches, is not as thick as a spring mattress, so the pockets of the fitted sheets for the appropriate size are too big. I am using sheet suspenders to solve this.

Really love my new mattress!",5 out of 5 stars review

I tested mattress out in several stores. I decided a after reading reviews and quality of the Spa Sensation that I would give it a try. I am very pleased with this mattress. The support and comfort and quality is all there. The price is well worth it. In fact the price I got it thru Walmart was lower than any place. The box is heavy and it may take two people to put it on the foundation. It unfolded right away even slept on it the first night.

There was no odor to the bed but as directed I did not sleep on the bed for 24hours ( up to 48hrs) I would rate the bed firm but not so hard it's bad. I love the memory foam toppers sold at Costco that aren't cheap but will also add that possible.  The matress has a cover that's like a quilted sheet so I'd suggest putting on a matress saver cover. You will truly be satisfied,  where else can you get a King with the upgraded platform base for $420. Delivered to the store...",5 out of 5 stars review
10/17/2013,We bought this to replace a full size mattress in our new camper. Camper mattresses are cheaply made and to buy something made for your camper after market is cost prohibitive. This mattress is ten times better than what you get in a camper. We modified one corner of the Spa Sensation mattress to fit the shape of the bunk and the width fit perfectly. We are so pleased we bought a second mattress for the other full size bunk in our camper.,5 out of 5 stars review

This mattress is very comfortable and the fabric wraps all the way around it so it is not unsightly from the underside of the loft. Comfortable mattress at a great price!",5 out of 5 stars review

3/24/2013,"After several online consumer rating review services and exhaustive online reviews of owner satisfaction reports of ""would buy again"" and ""don't waste your money"" I chose this mattress. I knew I wanted a memory foam mattress #1 because its NOT a traditional innercoil mattress. Every reviewer says memory foam sleeps hot which is fine by me because I have an electric blanket or throw on every sleep surface. It does isolate motion well and conforms beautifully-I am 5ft 6 in F-138#. Back and primarily side sleeper. No pre-existing pain issues. Many reviews say memory foam is the worst rated for recreational activity related to motion isolation. No complaints here.

There were a number of reviewers who had owned the mattress for several years and some complained that it doesn't hold up well over years of usage... but I figured if it lasts for 3 or 4 years, at this price (about 1/4 of the other memory foam mattresses), I can afford to replace it.",5 out of 5 stars review

It is so much more comfortable than our old spring mattress and I don't suffer from as many of the aches and pains I used to have upon waking. Set up was a breeze.

Even though the foam mattress states it is 6"" and leaving it outside to air out and to reach it's full size, it was only 5"". There wasn't a strong odor but I did spray it with Febreeze to make sure. It fits the width of the sofa sleeper very well but hangs off the end a couple of inches but not a real issue. I haven't attempted to keep it on the sleeper and try to fold it back into the sofa because of the overhang so there is now the issue of what to do with it when it isn't on the sleeper.

I tried the Sleep Memoir but found it to be too hard of memory foam for my personal preference, the Spa Sensations feels a little softer and the mattress cover on the Spa sensations is very nice and white with patterns on the top and sides when I bought it this time but years ago it was just a plain thin piece of material as the Sleep Memoir is now.",5 out of 5 stars review

I had another friend tell me about Walmart Spa Sensation mattress and she loved it. 
So I went online and after reading 20-30 of 7,000 plus positive reviews we purchased a King size mattress for under $400. Which is crazy to me. You can now buy a King under $500, AWESOME.

We felt it was time to get a new mattress and we had ordered 2 of the 6"" Spa Sensation mattresses for our sons and they loved them so much and they seemed so comfortable to my wife and I we thought we would give this 12"" Theatouch Memory Foam Mattress a try. It was thousands of dollars less then a new Select Number bed(and the one we paid for 14years ago). My wife and I couldn't be happier.

1/25/2014,This is the 2nd Spa Sensations mattress we bought for our daughters' bunk-bed. We first ordered one for the top bunk to see how our daughter likes. It fits in there perfectly and is super comfortable. I layed there myself (at 140 lbs) and found it very comfortable as well. We just received the 2nd one for the bottom bunk and this one is as good as the 1st. No problems with the mattress fully expanding (unlike some reviewers stated). We got both on sale so it was also a great value. Shipping was unbelievably fast (arrived in 2 days after placing an order). Highly recommended!,5 out of 5 stars review

This will be the best value you can orobable find. It is what I would consider plush not too soft nor firm. I weight about 180 if you need comparison. The only down side is that when u sit on the edge it sinks but why would you sit on the edge? Get it and stop wasting your time looking for other bed if you are looking for plush mattress.,5 out of 5 stars review
11/21/2016,"We bought this bed in a king size and it has exceeded our expectations! It feels like the 2-3k temperpedics that we tried out but it's only a fraction of the cost. The bed is soft, responsive, and supportive, without being overly soft. I recommended this bed to a family member and they purchased one too! I had no problems with inflation or a smell. It had a faint odor for a few minutes but it was quickly gone. Nothing to complain about. And the bed inflated evenly and quickly. About 15 mins. Our bed is the full 12"" compared to what other people have reviewed. I have nothing but good things to say about this bed and would recommended it to anyone and purchase it again!",5 out of 5 stars review
3/9/2017,"This is the best mattress that I have EVER slept on!!! I was hesitant to purchase because I had concerns that the quality would match the cheap price. But this mattress is Comfy, Super Thick and Reasonably priced. Took a while to get here, box was destroyed BUT my first night of sleep made up for all of that!!! This mattress decompressed completely in less than 1 hr!!! It is a really beautiful mattress, you owe it to yourself to buy this!!!",5 out of 5 stars review
11/28/2016,"incredible price. this is the 4th one we have purchased from spa sensations. slowly converted all guest rooms. 8"",10"", now 12"".  guests rave about these. best sleep ever!
This one is being  used in an antique bed; we had wood cut for slats; 6 of them. the others have the metal frames. I plan on purchasing a king for us in the spring.",5 out of 5 stars review
1/29/2017,"I bought this mattress after reading posts describing how to cut it with an electric knife in order to make it fit a camper van. I recently finished the platform for my camper bed, and bought and cut this mattress to fit it. I have only napped on it to date, but it seems very comfortable. So far I am very happy with it. We shall see if it stands the test of time, but for the price, I can replace it if necessary.",5 out of 5 stars review
3/17/2017,"This is the best sleep I've had in years. It has just the right amount of firmness, and I I fell asleep very quickly.

7/5/2014,"My college age daughter needed something for the sleeping loft in her efficiency so we decided to try this - the loft has a low ceiling and is carpeted - limited room but cozy. What a really great alternative to a heavier, bulkier traditional mattress - easy to handle but still so comfortable. We had an XL mattress pad leftover from the dorm, and it fit the 6"" perfectly. Regular sheets also fit. This was one of our bigger purchases for her, and she absolutely loves it. Visiting college age friends also approve so that seals the deal...",5 out of 5 stars review
2/17/2013,I wanted to try a memory foam mattress for a long time now so i decided to buy this one at a great price and i got to say this is a sweet bed. I no longer wake up with back pain. I strongly recommend that you take a chance on it. I see now why there are so many good reviews on this bed i will be buying a twin size one soon. 5 star all the way for me. Thanks wal-mart,5 out of 5 stars review
2/18/2021,When I first got the bed I was not pleased because the shape was kinda weird the head of the bed did take a little longer to inflate 3 days I let it sit.

I wake up soooo refreshed an ready to get my day started since I got this bed this is a must have,5 out of 5 stars review
8/8/2013,"Firm mattress. Very comfortable. I weigh 200 lbs and sink in about 4 inches on this 12 inch mattress. It is definitely NOT a pillow top. If you like a firm mattress you WILL love this one. It is firm, but since the weight is distributed better, you will not have any hot spots on your hips or elsewhere when you wake up. It arrives in a very heavy medium size box, and expands when you take the shipping cover off it. It has a zipped mattress cover, similar to a pillow cover.",5 out of 5 stars review
2/3/2013,"I bought this bed after reading so many great reviews. Still, I can't believe how comfortable this bed is, at such a great price! It definitely needs a firm foundation, like a platform bed or perhaps the spa sensations foundation that's recommended. On my old box spring it didn't feel firm enough. Flipped the mattress onto the floor for a night and loved it, so I went and got a platform bed. Love it! Love it! Love it!",5 out of 5 stars review
9/15/2013,"Walmart online special for $119 with free delivery. This mattress is an excellent buy for the money with none of the issues of not expanding correctly or having an odor after airing it out for 48 hours. Three different adults with two of them at about 200 pounds said that their night of sleep was awesome. As a 6 inch mattress it is perfect for single twin or bunk bed height. The only issue if you could call it that is the fitted sheet needed the elastic clips for the corners to keep the sheet from bunching up. These are a dollar store item, no big deal.",5 out of 5 stars review
2/28/2014,"My son first bought this to help with shoulder pain he had and it did work, then my niece bought it and said it's been the best sleep she and her husband had in years, I then ordered it for my 78year old mother to help with her leg pain in which she does not have anymore. Finally ordered it for myself and I love it also. if I had to say one thing that I don't care for is the smell, it's not real bad, I just have; as well as my husband, very sensitive nose.",5 out of 5 stars review

5/13/2021,Mattress arrived on time. Unpacked easily and expanded to full size in just minutes. I have been sleeping on it for a week now. It is very supporting and comfortable.

3/15/2021,I bought this for myself originally but then my older kids would come in my room and talk about how comfortable my bed was.

Its so soft but doesnt bother me even though I have back issues.,5 out of 5 stars review
8/31/2016,"I bought the mattress for my daughter who has complained of backaches and poor night's sleep for a while. I have had a memory foam mattress for several years and highly recommend the experience. So my daughter slept a couple nights on the Spa Sensations mattress, and she raved to me what a comfortable bed she has now and how she got up without aches and pains and how she loves the way the mattress distributes her weight and contours to her body. So all I can say is it was worth every penny!",5 out of 5 stars review
4/25/2013,"As much as i loved seeing all the reviews on the mattress before my purchase, I am forever the skeptic. Buying something you have not tried for yourself in store can certainly cause you to be cautious. I myself love memory foam, comparable mattresses are well upwards to a 1,000 or more. No thank you! The bed took about 24 hours in total to rise up to it's full size. The smell yes isn't the best, but a good ceiling fan to help rid of the smell is ok. My husband and I both love our bed! It's a miracle to not wake up with him getting in and out. I sleep deeper, and I notice my back is no longer in pain from sleeping. We got this mattress on sale, and most definitely love this! If you are in the market for a memory foam mattress look no further...",5 out of 5 stars review

4/24/2013,"We Love this bed. My wife and I are sleeping through the night and waking up feeling great. Bought this bed to replace a Sleep Number bed that had begun leaking and was going to cost almost as much to repair/replace as the Spa Sensation. Unpacking was easy and it fit our frame perfectly. Instructions said to wait 2 days before using to allow full expansion and we did, but it appeared to have fully expanded in just hours. We were told there might be a slight odor, but we did not notice any. Great bed at a great price for a great nights sleep.",5 out of 5 stars review
12/10/2013,"I ordered this product with a little reservation. The price is so low, I was afraid the quality might reflect the price. I was absolutely astounded by the quality of the mattress when it arrived. It took only 3-4 days to get here and after we opened the box, it expanded perfectly to its intended size and shape. The jacquard cover is comfortable and attractive. We've been considering a memory foam mattress for some time now and when I saw the price of this one I was surprised. We figured even if it wasn't quite what we were hoping for we could use it in the guest room. NO WAY AM I GIVING UP THIS MATTRESS! It's a tremendous value. I've recommended this product to all my friends. Great job Walmart...you hit a home run on this one!",5 out of 5 stars review

4/30/2014,"I love my new Spa Sensations 12"" mattress. I have never had a mattress that was a wonderful as this. I like a plush surface with support and this is it. It is so comfortable that I like to just lay there in the morning before getting up just to enjoy. It might be to soft for someone that wants a firm surface but if you like plush its wonderful. I don't have sore hips and shoulders when I wake up anymore. I went to the Spa Sensations web site to register the mattress and they give excellent descriptions of all their mattresses such as which are firm or plush and the features of each. I have nothing bad to say about it at all its all positive Love it.....",5 out of 5 stars review

It had a slight odor but of course it left within a few days. This is a great bed so far.",5 out of 5 stars review
11/30/2016,I love my new mattress! It is so comfortable and no more sore hips and shoulders.  I was warned that memory foam could be hot but I have not experienced any discomfort from too much warmth. The firmness of this mattress is perfect for me.  The delivery was within the expected time. Delivered right to my door. I brought it in the house and installed it by myself. I am 73. If course it was for a single bed but the way it is packaged and wrapped made it easy for me.   I have been sleeping on it for about a week but I am sold on the mattress.,5 out of 5 stars review

Shipping usually takes weeks but it shipped directly to us in a couple days after our order was placed. After opening the box the mattress was completely ready to go, no waiting for it to expand and no odor whatsoever.

I have a small frame, and am a small person, and I like to have a little give, but don't want to feel like stuck in the mud feeling. This bed is everything I could have asked for and more. I am so so so so so in love with this bed. The price is seriously shocking considering how well made it is. I would have paid $2000 for a bed like this, its that good.

3/27/2008,"I purchased this mattress using the site to store option, it arrived a little slowly compared to other items, but for its size and it shipping Yellow freight it was there quickly.
Basically this is a fantastic mattress. I have slept on a name brand memory foam mattress, Tempur... something or other, and this is pretty much identical. It seems firm, almost hard at first, but after a few seconds you melt into its thick memory foam surface and are cradled from there on. My mother helped me set it up and laid on it once it had reclaimed most of the air that had been sucked out of it. She compared it favorably with her super expensive air chamber Select something, something number mattress.

I am 72 years old and did have help setting it up initially, but the next day I needed to move it off the box springs in order to check something and I was able to completely move it on my own.

I also managed to get it out of the box and onto the platform bed I purchased at the same time by myself, but I would recommend having another person help you with this if at all possible.

There was a slight odor to the mattress, and after 2 days when I noticed it was still there I just sprayed some Fabreeze all over it & was done with the smell. Now 3 weeks into having the bed I feel like I'm sleeping on clouds! (No odor). There are NO regrets in ditching my old coil mattress. I absolutely am in love with this one.

It arrived very quickly, well-packaged in a box, and only required laying it out flat on the floor for two days to fully expand.  It is perfectly firm, yet soft enough to have a bit of ""give"" to it. I thought about getting an egg crate mattress to go on top of it, however, it really doesn't require one. It is the perfect  combination of firmness and softness. My six year old granddaughter will be able to use this mattress for many years to come and I am so happy with the purchase.

I have had a sore back almost every morning for over a year and it was improved overnight on the new bed. It came exactly when I was told when I ordered it and there was no smell at all.

9/5/2014,this mattress is about 11 inches at full high. It is heavy it weights 75 pounds so you might want to get someone to help with this and when you are taking it out of the package and plastic you want to make sure that you are in the place you want set it up until you are ready to put it on your bed. I did not smell no odor at all from this mattress. It sleeps like a dream. It is so soft and bounces back really quick after you get off of it. Deep pocket sheets fit on this mattress with easy. for the price you can go wrong. Best night's sleep since we started sleeping on this mattress. The last memory foam mattress we had was 8 inches and we slept on it for 7 years and it is still a good mattress but we wanted a higher mattress.,5 out of 5 stars review
8/3/2021,I've had this mattress in king size and now I have it in a full size. I had the king size for two years and still have it but I moved it into storage due to the need to downsize so I could open up some space while redecorating my bedroom. Let me say - super comfortable. I love this mattress in both sizes. It's so thick that I don't think you'd ever be able to feel whatever bed frame you put it on. No box spring needed. When I lay flat I feel like all the tension in my back is released but not like I'm sinking into the bed. It's a nice balance. Keep it clean by covering it with some form of a mattress cover. It will absorb any sweat that comes through the sheets and it will show so buy one ahead of time. Highly recommend :),5 out of 5 stars review

The deliver driver said that if the mattress was damaged to contact the shipper.  The box was able to get off the truck and the mattress fell out of it.  However, since the mattress was covered in plastic wrap, it was not damaged and didn't get dirty.  Very poor shipping, but EXCELLENT MATTRESS!",5 out of 5 stars review

I used to dread getting out of bed in the morning as my arthritis (age 45) would make my body so stiff every morning. After two nights on this mattress, I am no longer stiff and achey and I awake refreshed. Trust me, I'm NOT a morning person. The mattress inflated within minutes and this smell others are talking about is barely noticeable and dissipated in a few hours.  It's just like anything you purchase new. We followed the directions to a T, didn't sleep on it for 48 hours, as directed, no lumps, same shape all the way around. It measured 11.4 inches after it inflated out of wrapping.  We have been sleeping on it one week and it measures 12 inch...",5 out of 5 stars review

NO WHERE did I find a memory foam mattress at this price for any size, we got the full. If I had known that Walmart sold these online several years ago, I would have bought my memory foam mattress from Walmart and saved a lot of money! If you want a memory foam mattress, Buy this one from Walmart!, do not waste your time or money shopping around. You won't find a better deal out there on price and quality. This mattress is just as good as the more expensive Tempurpedics.",5 out of 5 stars review

2/20/2014,"After looking at other reviews for this mattress and seeing 3000+ reviews with 90% approval rating I purchased this mattress. My experience so far has matched those of other reviewers.
The mattress was very easy to set up, had minimal odor that dissapated in two days, and provides a very restful nights sleep with less morning stiffness and soreness. Yes, it is a little warm, but not very warm and since I sleep cold the warmth is an extra bonus.

My only concern is the longevity. The mattress cover seemed a bit thin, but I immediately got a high quality mattress pad to protect it--which did not make the mattress warmer, by the way. With such a low price, my feeling is if the mattress only lasts three years its a bargain",5 out of 5 stars review
9/23/2016,Everything went just as expected when I unpacked it. It expanded to the correct size and there was no odor at all.  I have been sleeping on it for a week and it is very comfortable.  The price was fantastic and I'm very pleased.  I recommend this product.,5 out of 5 stars review

10/15/2014,"I really LOVE the mattress. Unfortunately I bought a poorly constructed daybed from Hillsdale Furniture and it took me a while to figure out that the reason I was sliding off the mattress was because the bed deck was giving away.

It feels like laying on a cloud, yet is firm enough to not sag.",5 out of 5 stars review

I don't feel my partner move as much as I have with other, non memory foam mattresses (like when he gets up in the middle of the night), so I sleep through the night! It feels firm enough (I hate squishy mattresses) but still like I can sleep on my side without any pain in my shoulder. It has just enough ""sink"" to it.",5 out of 5 stars review

This ie an amazingly comfortable mattress. It said to allow 48-72 hrs for mattress to fully inflate. However, mine seemed to be fully ready within 5 mins. I did wait just over 24 hrs just to make sure 

Not hot like some memory foam. Great support while conforming to your body for maximum comfort. Strongly recommend.",5 out of 5 stars review

Now to the bed, I was leery about buying a foam mattress but I read all of the reviews and decided for the $ value that we really couldn't go wrong.  We didn't go wrong!!  We love the bed and are so happy we chose this particular one!  It is a  real value.  Within an hour of unwrapping it it had fluffed to almost 1/2 way and within 3 it was all of the way except for the corners and by the next morning it was King size.  Definitely worth every penny.

There is very little difference. This one is a bit firmer. I'm not sure if that's because it's brand new or just the mattress, but it's nothing so dramatic that I was uncomfortable or lost any sleep. I'm thrilled with this mattress. Per another reviewer's recommendation, I opened the mattress box on the platform and let it expand for 2 days. It's still not quite at 12 full inches, but certainly very close and I'd expect it will continue to expand as air moves thru the foam cells. I've very happy with this mattress and would buy again.",5 out of 5 stars review

10/26/2012,We bought this mattress for our teenage son. We have a more expensive memory foam mattress ourself but this one is not far behind.

8/27/2014,So great! We just got it a week ago - I recommend allowing it to open and sit unused for several days before sleeping in it. Starts out super soft...got much firmer 3 days later. Also we have regular box springs which were not optimal so I put down plywood over them creating a firmer platform. It's literally perfect. I sleep better on this spa sensations bed than I have in many years on a traditional mattress. Highly recommend!,5 out of 5 stars review

It arrived earlier than planned and was at full potential within 36 hours of opening. We purchased it along with the Zinus frame with head board. Everything was easy to put together and it takes all the pressure off my hips, shoulders and back. Feels like sleeping on a cloud and it just the right mixture of firmness and soft. Good quality for the price as we were looking for weeks and had thought about other brands at $1000. Happy with what we did.",5 out of 5 stars review

It had a little bit of an odor for the first week.  My husband and I slept on it after 6 hours of expansion. My shoulders and hips no longer hurt after one week of the best sleep ever.  We feel no movement transfer of each other.  After over a year there is no major dip in the mattress even though I am a very large woman.  The sides have stayed firm so you don√¢¬Ä¬ôt get that feeling like you√¢¬Ä¬ôre going to fall out of bed any second.  Others in my family bought a much more expensive memory foam mattress and this one has performed better.  This has been worth every penny!,5 out of 5 stars review
11/27/2013,"I bought this for my daughter and only wish I had gotten the 8"" because I feel it would have been just a little thicker for her needs and her back problems. She is totally satisfied and loves it. The only thing I had a problem with was the waiting to reach full heighth and was missing an inch on the 6"" side. Did quite make it but it still for the cost can not beat this. She also has just a mattress on a twin bed stand with headborad and still had the clearing for the headboard. It worked out wonderfully. It is worth it!",5 out of 5 stars review
10/1/2013,"- Received the order before the expected delivery date
- Just as advertised, product fully expanded to normal size within the 48 hour window.
- It's literally like sleeping on a cloud.

Don't go to a mattress store and spend $2,000 on a mattress -- this is a phenomenal steal deal. You won't be disappointed.",5 out of 5 stars review
6/24/2021,"I waited 2 months before I reviewed this mattress. I got the 6 inch queen bed and its absolutely the best mattress I have ever slept on. I didn't have issues with any smells when I opened it, left it alone for a day (it does take two for it to completely fluff out) because I moved into my apartment. I sleep so good. It is a firm bed but still soft enough for side sleepers like myself. My boyfriend says he sleeps the best when he sleeps over too so thats a plus! The nice thing too is that its small enough to be rolled into the backseat of my small car when its time to move- for those of you who live in apartments and dont want to rent a u-haul!",5 out of 5 stars review
10/20/2008,"From the first night I slept on this mattress I loved it,I had no back ache like I used to. After letting it sit on the floor in the spare bedroom for 2 days like the instructions said ,it did expand but not to the full 12"" like is advertised , it is only about 9"" thick but, the memory foam on top is still 3"" thick like it said. My husband and I would definitely recommend this mattress to any one with bad backs and hips.",5 out of 5 stars review
11/1/2013,"I usually have firm mattresses and I wanted to have the ""posturapedic"" ones but have not money for it. When I saw Wal-Mart has mattresses I decided to buy with my favorite store. after I enter in the web I found the theratouch memory and decided to buy it.
when you laydown on it is like being in the water because it has so soft foam that you sleep ""like and angel""
I would buy more for my family",5 out of 5 stars review
5/19/2018,Ordered the 12 inch full size mattress for our guest bedroom. It was delivered 2 days after I placed my order. Fits on a full size bed frame just fine. It expanded to the full 12 inches within minutes of cutting out of sealed bag. Set up was easy. Has new mattress/chemical smell but most new things do so I‚Äôm not bothered by it. We have a $4000 tempurpedic but this mattress is much softer and more comfortable. Low price for excellent quality. Very impressed and would definitely purchase again.,5 out of 5 stars review
8/13/2013,Just make sure that you are prepared to let this mattress sit for 48 hours before you even attempt to use it. I had to have my boys sleep on the floor because I got rid of their old mattresses before I opened the box for the new ones and read the instructions.,5 out of 5 stars review
8/30/2018,"I've used your typical box spring beds my whole life, never could afford the bigger name brand memory foam mattress before, till I found this brand, we have 3 in our house, a king, queen, an a full, once you cut the plastic it inflates within minutes, you don't have to wait the ""48hrs"" it recommends, we've been using them for the past few weeks an it holds up great, I'm a bigger man so the ""12 is plenty for me, never going back to spring again!.",5 out of 5 stars review
