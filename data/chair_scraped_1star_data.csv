12/3/2023,"years ago had a man try to convince me four inches were actually six inches. just as zinnus spa sensations tries very hard to convince consumers this mattress is six inches, see photo if Walmart will show it that shows that after 48hrs the mattress was only four inches not the six inches promised by zinnus.
having previously purchased a six inch memory foam mattress several years previous that was a dream to sleep on. 
after zinnus took over materials changed to the detriment of customers backs. 
do not know if because it never expanded to its full height but it was extremely uncomfortable to sit on, let alone actually sleeping on it for any length of time. 
the green tea infused 1.5 section is quiet a joke playing at customer expense. vast...",1 out of 5 stars review
11/8/2023,"The mattress did not expand to fully to 6"" even after 1 week after opening it. The zipper at the bottom ripped within 3 days. We could't zip it back because the edges were stitched. When we tried to return the mattress, the Fedex person refused to accept it because it is considered oversized.
Therefore, it is not a good product and Walmart's return process was not smooth in this case.",1 out of 5 stars review

I noticed swelling under my eyes and started getting headaches and seemed to be allergies and upon reading the specifications of this material this is a side effect of it.  I also wanted to wash the cover and went on the website to check for instructions, i read some reviews and it said it was a toxic matress and you couldn't wash the cover because you would be exposed to more toxic chemicals.  i called Walmart with my concern and since it had a 10 year warranty i called right away for help.

12/12/2013,"I recently moved and didn't have a bed. I spent a week sleeping on an air mattress waiting for this mattress to be delivered. It finally arrives at Walmart and I have to pull a favor from a friend with a truck to pick up this mattress and the platform bed frame I ordered specifically for this mattress. After about 60 hours of letting the mattress lay out, it is not fully expanded (they recommend 48 hours). It's barely half expanded. The middle is the only portion that is about 10 inches high (this is a 12 inch mattress). The rest of the mattress is about 4-6 inches high. The corners and very ends never expanded at all.

This thing is so flimsy, it has me thinking that maybe they made a mistake in manufacturing? The base is sooo soft it can't be considered a base at all. The three layers are coming apart on the ends and the corners refuse to decompress. The cover is so loose it looks like they put a King size cover on a queen.

12/18/2013,"I odered the Queen sized 12"" Theratouch Memory Foam mattress on Black Friday 2013 for what I thought was a great price of $229. However, the mattress I received was defective, uneven, and never decompressed at all. The mattress tag showed a manufacture date of 5/2012, so WalMart was likely trying to unload some very old stock as part of their Black Friday ""deal"" pricing. Kind of a shady move. Based on what I've read from multiple sources, memory foam does respond well to being compressed in storage for long periods of time. In my case, the mattress was compressed for approx 18 months. So, if you can luck out and get a mattress that was recently manufactured, you will likely not have these issues.

My sister had poor sleep every night she was here. She has one of these mattresses at home, but hers is about 5 years old. She said this is not the same mattress quality or feel as that one, so I can only assume the vendor has outsourced to other manufacturers and/or downgraded quality. I do not recommend this mattress.

This mattress is not plush, seriously. Mattress is too firm and does not feel comfortable at all. Take my advice and save the money and time.

This ridiculous mattress sat on my living room floor for over 4 weeks because it was awkward to coordinate a return. Finally I dragged it back to Walmart and had to find a way to bring the partially expanded mattress into the store. At least the return process was easy.

It's also not 12 inches. Another reason I took a chance on this is that one of the bad reviewers said Walmart came and picked it up and refunded their money.

in the box it came in.With a lot of effort I rolled it and took it back to walmart for credit. I ordered the
8 inch size,it came in very quickly.It""s not 8 inches thick but is comfortable enough and we will keep it.
The width also is not the size of full bed.Walmart's quality control should do a better job in inspecting
these. 6 INCH and 8 INCH should just that.Otherwise advertise the correct size.

I should get credit for all the trouble I went through.

1/3/2014,Mattress came folded (which is new to me) so I had to open it (after 5 days of arrival). Up to today (30 days later) the mattress has not expanded to its full capacity. The ends of the mattress has not expanded but the middle has but not fully. Still wavy. At the moment it also feels like sleeping in damp sand.

I am hot at night but this mattress even made me hotter than normal. Needless to say we were very disappointed.

When it is out of the box it comes in you need some strong people to move it around. Returning it to the store is very difficult as it is large unmanageable and heavy.

I have contacted customer service 6 or 7 times now and been told various conflicting excuses as to what the problem is. I have done my part and even confirmed with each party that their part is done. Walmart billing even “confirmed” that the return was received and my refund was issued, but I STILL DO NOT HAVE MY MONEY BACK! I will never again order anything from Walmart. This has by far been the worst customer service experience of my life!...",1 out of 5 stars review
6/5/2021,GARBAGE!!!!! I have ordered several mattresses from Walmart and this is the only one I think is garbage and hate..new home and out of the box following the instructions it sat for days The mattress never got to the size to fill the cover. If you sit on the edge it sinks and you slide to floor. Same with sleeping you cant sleep near the edge so useless to have a king when you have to sleep in the middle. I have never hated a mattress more! And of course I had no way to seal it back to return it or I would have!! HATE HATE HATE,1 out of 5 stars review
10/8/2021,"I purchased these and then learned two months after that they can be a danger due to the inner portion containing fiber glass. They’re being returned as soon as Walmart picks them up. 
The price is cheap, and they’re very firm.  Some people may not have an issue with fiber glass being used, but it was a deal breaker for me.  If you’re unaware of the potential dangers, look it up before deciding if this mattress is right for you.  You absolutely cannot remove the outer protective cover in order to keep the fiber glass contained, even though it has a zipper, which is dumb and dangerous.",1 out of 5 stars review

It showed up ahead of schedule which was great. I got the mattress unpacked and let it sit out for hours to get out to its full thickness. Unlike other reviewers mine did get to the full 12"" as advertised. I found that the bed was really hard the first few nights, but I thought perhaps after a bit it would soften up. Now it's been a few weeks and this mattress is still as hard as a rock. I find myself going and sleeping on my couch at times so that I wake up able to walk or even bend the next day.

9/13/2012,I bought this mattress after much research and peoples reviews. I should have went to a mattress store and tested one. I was also looking at Sleep Number Beds and such as a replacement for my waterbed. The price they wanted to fit my hard sided framed waterbed was too expensive so I settled on this. To make a long story short I will make this mattress to make indoor and outdoor seat cushions. The only way it is comfortable is if you sit on it. I could only manage 3-4 hours of sleep and even after I put extra padding on the bed. I now sleep on an air mattress until my new waterbed arrives. I recommend going to a store and test any mattress before buying. People's opinions are what they are and this is mine.,1 out of 5 stars review

Take my review very seriously. The weight difference really matters. The cheap memory foam degrades very quickly.

I didn't even think that it would barely skim 6 inches and what that really meant. If you plan to use a box spring this may be ok, but you will definitely need more mattress if it's for a platform! If you really want a memory foam I guess you should just spend the money on that otherwise you will end up paying extra to compensate like me. I also got a king. 12...",1 out of 5 stars review
11/1/2009,"I bought this mattress in king size a while back and am very happy with it. However, I just received a queen sized one and it is very squishy and offers no support. My original king sized one will only compress to 9 inches on the corner, but the new queen sized one compresses to 2 inches!

9/14/2014,"When the box arrived at my apartment, it looked a little small to have a full sized mattress inside. When I took it out of the box, it pretty much looked like a flat piece of foam. 3 days later, it's not looking much better. It was supposed to top out at 6 inches, but it's 4 in. max. I'm practically sleeping on the floor. I blame myself for going to cheap route. Oh, and by the way, it smells awful. I've already ordered a traditional mattress and box spring.

5/5/2013,"Purchased and had 12"" Spa Sensation shipped to our local WalMart when the 12' gel version was not available.
Mattress was un-boxed and plastic was removed from mattress to start decompressing while we waited for mattress pad to come into store. Pad was picked up this past Saturday (May 4th).
It has been over 72 hours and mattress still has not fully decompressed.
Some areas are maybe 6 to 8 inches and others are no more than 3"" or 4"". The 3"" to 4"" areas all seem to be the outer edge of the Mattress. It is not rectangular. More trapezoidal shape than being a mattress.
Of note, was that the Certificate for Federal compliance packaged with mattress indicates that it was shipped (from China) on May 2012.

Well, after about 5 days I've decided to send this junk back. I can record a video and upload it to Youtube to show you this thing does not leave a hand-print in it like real memory foam mattresses do. My friend bought one of the real one's that ranged in the thousands and no, it is not the same.

It had a really nice firm yet soft feel when I first got it. Had wonderful nights rest, now it's just ridiculously soft and the edges where my feet are barely return to its original shape.

8/17/2011,"In search of the perfect matress and months of research on various mattress forums, I was lead to believe that the Spa Sensations 12"" would be the answer to my prayers in search of the perfect night's sleep.

Furniture stores can't give you that same guarantee.

Unfortunately, my 12"" Spa Sensations mattress didn't work out. The first night I slept on it (I let it expand for 24 hours) the pain from the base of my neck to my lower back and numbness in my arms would not let me fall asleep. I was up tossing and turning all night because of the pain.

10/25/2012,"After shopping for weeks I finally caved and bought this mattress based on all the good reviews. What I received is certainly not what I was expecting. First off the product description is wrong stating that the queen mattress should weigh 115 lbs when it actually weighed more like 72 lbs. After unwrapping the mattress and letting it expand for a week it never got anywhere near the advertised height of 12 inches. It was more like 9.5 inches and quite deformed, certainly not a typical box like bed shape. The biggest problem was that the bed wasn't anywhere near firm, it was so incredibly soft that I sunk in deep causing further back pain.

I bought the mattress for a guest room. Had it been for a room that is used daily I would not have tolerated it. It just so much work to make a return on an item this large after you have already carried it to the second floor of your home.

We are not big people at all and yet we found this not to be supportive. We were hoping to find relief from pressure points in our shoulder and hip areas, but this made it worse! Every time one of us would turn over or leave the bed, the motion transfer was very noticeable. The edge of the mattress is so soft that if you're not careful, you can fall out of the bed. Wish we had known that before it was purchased! Be forewarned, you get what you pay for ! It does sleep warm (if you sleep at all). Might work for a single person but certainly not for two.

Weâve been sleeping in our guestroom for FOUR MONTHS â we have no idea how this could be returned â so weâre just giving it away on craigslist.

Other issues:
Matress never inflated to a proper king size â itâs an inch or two off in each direction so it doesnât fit properly in our west elm platform bed frame

If you have any type of issues with allergies â do not buy this mattress.

HUGE waste of time and money.

I think a lot of these reviews are paid/compensated by people getting the mattress for free",1 out of 5 stars review
3/26/2019,"Do not buy! The smell is horrible, like stale mold! The instructions say let the bed air out for a couple of days (we did) In a spare bedroom, with a fan on. However it’s been almost 3 weeks now and it still smells! We have washing the cover, spreading baking soda on the foam itself, jumping on it, and bowls of vinegar in the room (internet tips) but still nothing! Do yourself a favor and buy a better foam mattress.",1 out of 5 stars review

I am back using my 10 yr old mattress and no longer waking up with lower back pain. Hoping they will honor their warranty!

Unfortunately neither Walmart nor the manufacturer included directions or an 800 customer line to call should the mattress be defective. We are not even sure we have the right mattress because neither the box nor its contents refer to the mattress we purchased. It is certainly not 12 inches in any area of the mattress .

We left windows open all day to get the horrible smell out. I slept the first night and when I woke up I couldn’t talk. My voice was gone. I felt like coughing but I couldn’t as if it was trapped in my throat! Today’s the 4th day we been sleeping on couches in living room. The smell is still very strong even after four days!

7/29/2019,"I ordered the 6 and 8 inch full size versions. Afterward I saw the reviews warning of the fibers. The mattress consists of three layers of foam attached together. This is surrounded by a mesh bag. This all is covered with a nice outer covering which appears could be unzipped and cleaned and slid back on but it can't. There is a label telling you not to remove the outer bag, just spot clean. Because of my concern I carried the mattresses outside and removed the two outer bag coverings. The mesh covering is the fiberglass culprit. In cutting it off there was fibers everywhere. My eyes were irritated and my clothes covered.

I took a gamble and ordered a memory foam, thinking springs were not the way to go with these bed in a box beds, and the foam would be better. The reviews on this matress are very good. I read them for days. I ordered one in January. I was happy to get it, the first bed in a box experiment failed, and I wanted a good nights sleep. I gave the bed in a box concept one more chance.
It's a beautiful bed. It filled out nicely; the cover is pretty and feels good.

1/16/2020,"The mattress is pretty and looks comfortable, it is made of more natural components which is great.

The problem is while the top of the mattress is soft and made of memory foam, while you sleep at night you wake up in pain in the middle of the night, as if you were sleeping on a wooden bench. It's as if under the first top layer, the inside of the mattress was extremely hard. I used to sleep on firm mattresses all my life and not one of them was ever as painful as this one. The only time I felt this kind of pain is when I was sleeping in the middle of the woods, in a sleeping bag.

12/24/2019,"This is my 4th bed from Spa Sensations (previously owning a size king and 2 twins). Up until this mattress, I loved them!  I ordered a 12 inch size full and slept on the couch for 3 nights waiting for the mattress to fully “recover” before putting sheets on. The mattress only expanded to 10 inches and is very hard. So I paid for a 12 inch but received a 10 inch. Not happy about this at all. Need to stop my mother from ordering one.",1 out of 5 stars review
9/7/2017,We bought this mattress in 2015 and in a year time it became very soft that we are getting backpain frequently.

This is waste of money and space in your house. Beware !,1 out of 5 stars review
4/28/2013,"This was a great mattress for about a month but now it is almost completely unusable. For full disclosure, I am a very large guy weighing more than 500 lbs. I did my due diligence, looking at weight limits on foam mattresses. I read through all 12 pages of the Q&A of this product, looking specifically for the weight limit. Many people reported success with combined weights exceeding my individual weight.

When it initially arrived, it was easy to move about, it does come compressed which you air out and there is a slight odor which does dissipate after time. For the first month, it was fantastic, not much back pain and there was no noticable dip. I felt supported even when sitting upright to watch TV. However, gradually over the next month ...",1 out of 5 stars review
9/12/2018,I had a 4 inch and decided to purchase the 6 inch with hope that it would be softer. It turns out to be so firm and hard that it’s not comfortable at all!

6/29/2015,"We originally ordered this mattress in November of 2014. Once it arrived and we set it up it never fully inflated. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent out a new replacement. At that point it got worse.
For the first few weeks the mattress was better than the old one we replaced. After a few months it was getting pretty uncomfortable. Both my wife and I have been having more and more back pain. Recently we stayed at a hotel and had the best night of sleep in months with almost no back pain in the morning.
It has now been almost a year and a half and it is going in the trash today!! Don't waist your money.",1 out of 5 stars review

8/29/2011,"With so many glowing reviews and high star marks I feel bad to say that this bedding was a big miss. The instructions were easy, the setup was quick. The first couple of nights I dreamt about drowning -- but no back pain. Then it showed up in spades. The premise is that the bedding conforms to your shape -- but it just swallowed me pretty much whole.

Still, I'd look at a foam memory bed a couple of years from now. They seem to improve with over time (word is the earlier versions had an awful chemical smell).",1 out of 5 stars review
3/10/2009,"We purchased this bed after hearing all the great reviews on Memory Foam. However the first night on the bed was also the last. This was like sleeping on a board. In fact, the board may have been more comfortable. True, there were no pressure points. the whole bed was pressing back on our whole bodies creating a very painful experience. I woke up sore all over. My husband after about 2 hrs of no sleep moved to the couch for more comfort.",1 out of 5 stars review
4/1/2013,"I bought this during July 2012 and good i'm writing the review now. Initially for a few days the mattress was pretty thick and my husband felt the mattress needs some time to get set. Even now, its like sleeping in rock. Instead of calling in memory foam, i would say its 'amnesia' foam. There is completely no comfort. Despite loosing the sleep during the night, me and my husband started developing back ache too. And when we wake up by morning, its like we are out of tai chi with our whole body ache. I would suggest to spent some more bucks and go for a good branded one. Atleast when you are paying by installments, you will atleast have peaceful sleep at night and feel its all worth it.",1 out of 5 stars review
1/3/2011,"I HATE this mattress! After 10 days it still stinks, but more importantly, it's TOO SOFT. I mean, I know it's foam, but after reading the reviews that seemed to state it might even be too firm, I took the plunge and purchased it. However, I sink in and stay stuck in it. There's no support and I despise the mattress. I'll probably end up keeping it because it might not be worth the hassle of returning. If you're looking for anything but an extra soft mattress, don't purchase this. Plus, it only has a 5 year warranty, which is truly not a lot when it comes to mattresses. DON'T make the mistake of purchasing it without trying it or a very similar product, as you might end up regretting it like I do.",1 out of 5 stars review
12/15/2009,Purchased this mattress about 6 months ago..was never able to get use to it...always woke up with upper back pain.

12/19/2013,I received this mattress several days ago with much anticipation. This mattress was allowed to sit for two whole days with the corners never fully expanding. Beyond that it is so soft it feels like you are sinking every time you lay or sit on it. When laying down at night the mattress feels as if you might roll off. This mattress will certainly be returned. I am very disappointed with the purchase. Buyer Beware!,1 out of 5 stars review
5/18/2015,"This mattress is very soft. I weigh 130lb and when I sit down on it I sink to the edge of the bed entirely, so I'm sitting on the bed frame not mattress material.

It's lacking support.",1 out of 5 stars review
11/3/2013,"I purchased this mattress in the queen size (over $400). I didn't realize the top would be so soft. I also didn't realize I would be drenched in sweat while trying to sleep on the mattress (I had a ceiling fan, a portable fan on and I opened my bedroom window - to no avail).
When I lied down I sunk into the mattress and it was a real effort just to turn over. The mattress has no support to speak off.
I already discarded the original packaging because I didn't anticipate such major problems with this purchase.
I slept about 3 hours altogether on this mattress that so many other people just loved - I'm afraid I have to buy another mattress and lose the purchase price of this brand new mattress.

6/10/2012,"I bought this mattress for my granddaughter to sleep on over the weekend. Last week I was real excited about getting a foam mattress for such an excellent price. WOW!!! I WAS WRONG IN THIS PRODUCT. She slept on it one night and complained it was just too hard. She is a six year old and weighs around 50 - 60 lbs and is quite tall for her age. Not only is she thin but speaks her mind when something is not right. So I, the grandmother laid down on it and my hips ached terribly with in two minutes. It was like laying on an exam room table. There was very little give for a person who weighs 160 lbs. That is why it was super hard for a little child. Do NOT GIVE THIS TOO A CHILD if they like soft and comfortable mattresses.

Unfortunately, this mattress is not comfortable, is not 6 inches thick and is not usable. It is not a quality product. We purchased 9 inch mattresses from another company with much better results. They put 3 inches of foam on top of a sturdy material to give support. Packaging was much better from the other company as well. I wouldn't even use it as a mattress topper.",1 out of 5 stars review
3/23/2017,"I bought this mattress a couple weeks ago and it's literally one of the worst purchases I ever made. It is too firm. You can't turn or move at all to get comfortable. I added a feather mattress on top to see if that would help it but nope , it's horrible. I researched this item for months. It's impossible to return because once you unbox it ,you own it because it's so massive. I like the idea of it coming in the mail and i didn't think I would have to return after all the positive reviews.  I have been a loyal Walmart customer for over 25 years and this is the worst item to buy online. HELP SLEEPLESS IN MARYLAND!!!",1 out of 5 stars review

It is hard as a rock to sleep on. My husband often woke with a sore back with our old mattress - but I never did, and we purchased this because the reviews were so great and we have realtives who love their (different brand) foam mattress.

9/2/2013,"When we first saw this product on-line we were hopeful because it had so many reviews. I know 6 in mattresses are not as comfortable as thicker mattresses but this mattress was worse than the other three 6 in foam mattress we currently have. Even the mattress that I refuse to sleep on because it is not comfortable was better then this. Even my husband, who doesn't notice a difference in most beds, doesn't find the bed comfortable.

I currently have no back problems but every time I laid down on it my back would hurt. I tried sleeping on it and I literally tossed and turned all night. This was supposed to be a bed for guests but If I wouldn't want to sleep on it, even for a night, I don't want to put my guests though that.

Nothing happened. I mean it didn't even inflate an inch. It just sat there just as it came out of the box. One would say when you buy a cheap item you get what you pay for but in this case I didn't even get what I paid for. In the end I rolled the mattress right back to the same box it came in and returned it to Walmart. I guess, be mindful of this possibility when you order and make sure you have a means to return this if it doesn't workout because returning this thing is a major chore.",1 out of 5 stars review
