7/7/2023,Came last night and set up was easy. At first it worked and was a lovely picture but this morning nope! Smartcast Home not available. Which means the tv won't work! What's the deal with this???? It's been almost an hour and nothing!!,2 out of 5 stars review
3/19/2023,"Sold me the completely wrong TV. And it's broken/useless. 

Ordered the Vizio Smart TV 65‚Äù new, and got a USED, BROKEN, DIRTY, TCL missing the power cord and the remote, all inside of a Vizio box.

 Of course I did not know this was the product I had ordered. Now I have to deal with a broken, incorrect, unusable TV just sitting around. 

It was delivered to me as after I ordered it for pickup; then they said pickup wasn't available; then I thought everything was fine after it was delivered - until I opened it up and was about to start mounting it. 

Never buying from Walmart again‚Ä¶",2 out of 5 stars review
3/23/2023,Very disappointed in this TV. Sound is terrible. Need to turn volume high to hear it and then it‚Äôs such a tinny sound it‚Äôs difficult to listen to. Would not recommend. Not sure if company would replace but hope they do. I‚Äôve always bought Vizio before.,2 out of 5 stars review

3/4/2023,Not even a year yet and the TV picture has scratch marks on the color that go left and right across the screen.  Vizio is usually a good brand.

But the fact that only 2 months after buying it new the screen started going out in spots, then can streaks across the screen, flashing spots, and lines from side to side top to bottom constantly changing. You cannot use it for anything I bought it for. You cannot see a clear picture anymore. I‚Äôve tried resetting it to factory, I‚Äôve tried updating it but nothing works.

2/1/2024,My last Visio tv lasted years. This one is HD and the picture is not as good as my last one. It changes to different color modes without being selected. It will also go from the volume I have selected to really loud on its own. You ask why I have not returned it? I am almost 70 and getting it in the car would be very difficult at best. I put my old tv in this ones box and my brother came and helped get rid of it. Hate this tv!,2 out of 5 stars review

Likes: Size, picture quality, sound, smart tv loaded with most apps I use. 

Dislikes: Strong electoric smell when in use, noticeable humming when tv is used for extended time. 
Something that started recently is the TV randomly going black screen after a couple hours of use. TV stops responding besides powering down. This has happened 3 times in the last week and it never happened before.",2 out of 5 stars review

1/12/2024,"The tv for the most part is fine. The issue I have is it's preloaded with a bunce of apps nobody I know uses. Most of the apps are for pay programming, not free. Apps like Disney, Netflix, Hulu, Max, Sling. I wanted a TV that I could load with MY apps, not decided on by Vizio. You can't add any, and you can't remove any either!

11/18/2023,"The actual hardware of this TV is nice. It has a gorgeous picture, and a really nice and sturdy feeling construction. It looks and FEELS like a premium tv, which is impressive at this price

Where it falls apart is the OS this tv runs. Unlike the Roku OS, which has a simple homescreen that shows your apps and recent inputs, this Home Screen is annoying crap that gets in the way

It‚Äôs mostly movies and tv shows it‚Äôs trying to shove down your throat, and the app bar is shoved out of the way.

Worst of all, it comes pre installed with tons and tons of apps, and you can‚Äôt delete any of them!!! Junk like ‚ÄúFailArmy‚Äù are permanently on my TV and in the way when I just want to access YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix. It‚Äôs an absolute pain.",2 out of 5 stars review
11/13/2023,"After the sixth purchase of Vizio TVs, the/55 inch I just received, has been a grave disappointment. My first visit was about 10 years ago and it lasted about eight years of almost continuous play. I stream HD content almost 24 hours a day since retiring . The TV even plays while I'm sleeping most nights. 

These lcd screens have come a long way recently. I've got a large competitors panel in a family room and although it's priced a bit higher the difference in screen detail and artifact problems is significant. This Vizio model has done nothing to address black bleed and serious edge blurring problems I coups have overlooked in older panels.

10/1/2023,"Once it's on it functions okay. Sometimes it takes a few tries and a power cycle from the toolkit page to get it to show the home screen. Also, it won't turn off. It turns off, then five seconds later turns back on. So to turn it off you have to unplug it. I would return it but by the time I had a chance to deal with it, the return window had closed.

8/7/2023,"So the TV works OK. Not great. The resolution is no better than our old one that died (1080ppi), and this is supposed to be a 2160ppi resolution. It's disappointing.

Streaming is okay. So far, no buffering. The drawbacks are as follows... 
1.) The screen ratio/dimension is smaller than our old one even tho it is the same size - 43""
2.) Amazon Prime Video, the screen display ratio is even worse. The picture doesn't fill the screen - you get the old top and bottom black bars - ""cinema or widescreen view"" even tho the TV is a widescreen 16:9 ratio. Go into settings, and you have one option for screen display - ""Normal"" - and nothing else, so you can't really adjust it. Why even offer it, if you can't adjust it. Pointless.

3/15/2023,"Loved this TV when I first got it. But over the past 2 months, the built-in Chromecast has been significantly becoming more and more difficult to get to work. I should not have to turn on/off my TV and phone multiple times to get a show to cast. Yes they are on the same network, yes my network connection is great, yes it is right next to the router. The issue is the built-in Chromecast SUCKS. I pulled out my old (likely around 10 years old at this point) Chromecast and VIOLA - works perfectly. 

The reason I bought this specific brand/model was for the built-in Chromecast. Really disappointed that it's gone to poop after 2 months. Wish I would've purchased a less expensive option, this was not worth the higher price tag.",2 out of 5 stars review

3/28/2023,"I loved this TV at first. It was easy to set up, even adjusting whatever I had to do to align speaking with lips moving. But lately it's been not good. It won't load, constantly lagging, screen is black, says network unavailable, even though it shows it's connected. I feel like I'm rebooting every day, sometimes multiple times. It's not my internet connection, as I bought a new router and everything else in my house connected to Wi-Fi works great. It's sad because I spent more for a great brand name, and now feel like I should have stuck with a cheap Tv.

5/15/2022,"This is a great tv don't get me wrong but there are issues. To begin with, if you leave the tv on for an extended period of time, say overnight, you will have to reset your tv by unplugging it. This happens quite frequently unfortunately. Sometimes the tv will freeze and power down, it will then not power on unless you unplug it. Now the issue is the audio, I powered my tv on after being gone all day and now my audio isn't working and you won't believe what I did to fix it! That's right unplug once again! It's seems the only way to fix the issues to unplug and start over. I've only had this tv for about a month and wish I would have spent the extra money on a Samsung. With that being said beware before you buy.",2 out of 5 stars review
11/28/2022,"This is our fifth Vizio TV, and the first one that is a disappointment. The claim of 4k fidelity is a joke. There's no detail or sharpness in the picture, it almost seems as though the focus is a little off, or it's displaying at a lower resolution (according to the system info, it isn't).  

Adding injury to insult, I went online to their support page, and they handed me off to the JustAnswers website - which charged me $46 just to tell me to re-read the manual or return the TV.  

It gets two stars because it actually works with all the Smartcast and streaming apps - albeit with the ""soft focus"" display issue.  I could get pretty much the same functions with a $30 Roku stick. The price was right, but I would NOT recommend this model to an...",2 out of 5 stars review

I turn the TV on and I'm bombarded with three rows of content, with ads on top and in the middle and my actual apps and inputs on the bottom. The only options for powering on are to have the TV load the SmartCast screen or to load the last input used, which in my case is a gaming console, and there are no customization options for the SmartCast homescreen besides reordering the preinstalled apps.
