4/8/2023,"fantastic picture and insanely good price considering the picture and features. not a fan of the video set up and registration process compared to when I set up the one in my master bedroom which is the same TV just an older version from 2 years ago. I like the upgraded remote and think most people with smartphones will love the setup process. I'm just a little old school. quickly set up with my streaming device, though average users can happy use onboard apps from the app store.",4 out of 5 stars review
6/8/2023,"The tv is great, it started out disappointing because some apps were working and some weren't, but all we did was call Vizio and they fixed the problem from their end! Great customer service and it was a quick fix! Loving my new tv so far! Great picture quality!!",4 out of 5 stars review

12/29/2023,"for the price during the Black Friday sale I mean I don't really feel like I got off Black Friday deal. That's just me being personally honest, the real Black Friday savings didn't start until a couple days before Christmas. personally, that's just from my observation. At first I ordered a 43 in forgot that I had a 43-in in the living room and wasn't content. so decided to go for a 55-in Samsung but after realizing that I would have to wait nearly a week. I found the 50 in V-Series which for $345 after tax and delivery I mean it is what it is. If I can get three years without any issues I'll be surprised and maybe I'll feel as if it was worth every dollar not saved for Black Friday. with all seriousness, I wanted something within a couple h...",4 out of 5 stars review
8/2/2023,"The tv is ok. Picture quality is fair in my opinion 
My older tv had a better picture. That came w our house. Not sure if the age. But older, heavier, not a smart tv. A Sony. Had very crisp, bright pic. This Vizio could be better. Still a heavy tv, too. Expected it to be lighter.",4 out of 5 stars review
5/23/2021,"Picture is crisp, clear and amazingly vivid. Impressive package of the latest features offered in televisions.
Highly recommend sound bar with this tv any tv over 40-inch needs audio enhancement. We didn't have sound bar but will purchase one for this size. Does have built in features to adjust audio without soundbar, adequate.
Shipping and delivery were satisfactory. Notification for delivery was updated every 6-8 hours prior to delivery. 
TV was packaged extremely well. Front of box had sizable dent in cardboard, yet inside was unaffected.
Paper instructions for hook-up, plug- in were simple and easy to follow. USB ports were well marked. Bonus point: having bright colored, designated sound bar port was a nice feature.

7/11/2023,"Both TVs were delivered promptly and in good working order.  Very good value!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the prompt of a tip for the delivery driver -- suggested $50 !  To my knowledge, TVs would not be delivered by Instacart and ""Free Delivery"" is expected to be just that.  I removed the tip, but there should be no assumption or pressure to pay a tip to a delivery driver that works for Walmart (or UPS).  The expectation of a tip for performing a job (outside of the service industry where less than minimun wage is typical) is getting out of  hand!",4 out of 5 stars review

2/18/2024,"I enjoy the clarity. However, I bought a smart TV to have easy access to all the streaming channels and there is no Roku. I use roku for my religious channels. also, the start button has to be pressed about 3 times before the tv will come on. Normally I prefer VIZIO to any other TV. Vizio always has a great picture and none of the usual problems you might have with other TV's.",4 out of 5 stars review
2/6/2024,"I like my TV a lot. The color is vivid and for the most part it was very easy to set up. It does need screws for the feet to stand erect. The screws weren't in the box. It wasn't delivered to my door so I had to carry it to my apt from downstairs. However, it did come early which was nice. Overall I'm pleased with the product and service.",4 out of 5 stars review
11/6/2023,Purchased this tv for my elderly mom. Like most smart TV's it was difficult to program for her because you have to download an app to program. Most elderly have no idea what that is. There should be a way to bypass this to just setup the live tv only option.,4 out of 5 stars review
1/4/2024,"I do not like the remote that comes with the tv. It is not user friendly and doesn't have a number pad. So you have to scroll back and forth to get to specific channels. 

The volume is really loud on commercials. No instruction manual was included, so I had to research how to turn on the smart settings so that the volume would automatically adjust.  Howvever, that doesn't work very good and doesn't stay on auto volume adjust.  Be prepared to watch a LOT of ads for Vizio products that are in addition to all other normal tv advertisements.  The most positive thing is that the pictur quality is great.",4 out of 5 stars review
1/2/2024,I like the picture quality and it hooked up easy to wifi with alot of internet options. But after 2 months. I came home from work and turned it on and the picture was all pink.

1/13/2024,"This is a surprisingly nice tv for the cost. Picture is crisp and clear. The only thing that was weird is how long it took to turn on.

1/9/2024,So I went with this Vizio as I purchased 2 Samsungs and both arrived damaged. I picked this one up so I would've have to deal with the same issue. The packaging was excellent. The TV was very protected. The set up was simple no issues at all. The quality isn't bad so I am pleased with the picture quality. The sound quality impressive as well. The reason I couldn't provide a 5 star rating is because of the remote. I've never had a tv with a remote that doesn't seem to work no matter where I point it. It's very frustrating. It's like the batteries are dying and they are brand new.,4 out of 5 stars review
1/20/2024,I previously had an onn branded tv that started to develop horizontal lines on the screen so I decided it was time to upgrade. So far this Vizio tv is amazing! The speakers sound great and the colors really pop! I never realized how grey and washed out the colors on my old tv was until I got this one! It also looks and sounds even better when I hooked up my Ps5! As of right now the only thing I don't care much for is the ads on the home screen and the remote really needs a dedicated play and pause button. Otherwise im currently very happy with my purchase,4 out of 5 stars review
7/24/2023,"customers should be informed when purchasing a 4K tv that other equipment needs to be compatible in order to use this feature on the tv such as 4k dvd player, 4k hdmi compliant cables, 4k streaming service, etc., otherwise no sense in purchasing for this feature if you cant use it.",4 out of 5 stars review
8/31/2023,"Excellent picture for the price point. It has  awesome features and Apps as well. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is that, the volume(speakers) leave more to be desired however, if you add a vizio or your favorite brand sound bar, the movies really does comes to life. I’d definitely recommend even with adding a sound bar (as most people do with any  large TV screen purchases anyway) it’s still a great buy for a budget tv. You won’t be disappointed if you do.",4 out of 5 stars review
10/4/2023,"Overall for this price point a very good television. The picture is very good and the apps work great. Reasons for not giving 5 stars: On ""antenna"" mode the channel number does not appear on the screen and the remote control does not allow you to channel up or down, you have to constantly go to the guide in order to change channels. Also, the apps icon line on the home screen is very small compared to the other lines which seems strange.",4 out of 5 stars review
6/30/2023,It was easy to find what I wanted.  The price was reasonable and it was delivered the next day as promised.

12/20/2023,the only thing that I really don't like about it is that it does not have a timer to set that turns the TV on in the morning to function as an alarm clock. usually I would set the timer and turn the volume on the television all the way up so that it would turn on in the morning and wake me up. I'm thinking about actually getting a different TV the next go round in about a month or so and making sure that it has a timer that I can set on it to turn it on.,4 out of 5 stars review

11/2/2023,Only one thing to complain about that I wasn't looking for when picking out this t.v.. It has legs not a stand. I have small children and can get rowdy. I don't trust the legs.

My negatives: 1) the free Vizio channels have waaaaaaay too many ads (every 30 seconds seems to be another annoying ad for Kevin's frozen meals).  It's quickly become too painful to watch; 2) there is no internet connectivity capability that I know of; 3) I suggest a soundbar of some sort.",4 out of 5 stars review

My only two complaints are that I have to forget and re-pair Bluetooth headphones because the audio glitches if I don't (none of my headphones have this problem with other smart devices or tvs).

It seems to get super soft/lout for random reasons.  I've tried tweaking some audio settings, and it seems better than when we plugged it in.  It's light, and our old mount fits great...it does NOT work with our old DVD player that connects with the R-Y-W plugs...but the new DVD player i then bought, with a HDMI cable works great.  the biggest issue right now, is that it goes back to the home...",4 out of 5 stars review

4/28/2023,"Decently bright, but I don't have access to a lot of 4K content so I can't comment on native 4K. Upscaled 1080i/p and 720p looks fine.
Voice control through included remote is a nifty feature.
Suite of installed apps includes things like YouTube and Netflix.

Comments:
It comes in a huge box, but is surprisingly lightweight for its size. 
If you have short arms, you might want to get a long-armed friend to help you in moving it around, as it's not so much heavy but awkward.
Also, if you are not wall-mounting this set, pay careful attention when installing the feet, as they are very similar but not interchangeable.",4 out of 5 stars review

I replaced it with this 50”  and I’m not even like WOW 4K. That 5-9 year Samsung model which weighed about 100lbs was wayyy clearer and crispy than this brand new more advanced technology tv. 
While the Samsung was $110 more, it didn’t even have the RCA audio output or video RCA that I wanted for my stupid HF security cam. 
Not sure if the Samsung could connect to my network wirelessly but I like how this one can. Perfect for the garage where I had the used Samsung.

7/17/2021,"The Vizio is the 3rd smart tv we have owned and not the best. Sometimes the smart cast will not load and you have to unplug the t.v for a few seconds and plug it back in. Sometimes the t.v will not turn on and it has to be unplugged and plugged back in. There is no way to change the channel from the t.v. the only buttons on it are power, volume, and input which is really annoying because sometimes the remote doesnt want to work. You cannot add or delete apps. So if I dont want the youtube app but would like to have the HBO app there's nothing you can do.

We own an older, smaller vizio TV that is in our bedroom. 

This has a nice design to it and set up is super easy. Even if you aren't tech savvy I don't see you having an issue with set up. It paired to our WiFi very easily with no issues.

12/12/2022,"I think this is a really nice TV with one simple complaint that i think they could abolish with a software upgrade. On the Roku TV's the menu is super simple and by channel number. This system has NO menu for antenna channels. Very frustrating and unless you have your channel numbers memorized you have to scroll through all the channels to get what you want. The menu they have for the other channels is very hodgepodged and jumps all over by catagory rather than station number. If they had this straightened out it would be a 5 star for me.

I don't know what else to say. I'm glad I was able to drop my cable service, however, some of the shows I used to watch aren't available and I'd have to add a streaming service at an additional $70/month.

I watch a lot of Tennis and on every other TV I've ever owned the sound of someone hitting a Tennis ball is sort of like you'd expect, a sort of thud sound.

The Good: Set-up and ease of use, and free channels. The colors are OK but I will give Vizio credit as you have lots of options to tweak and store TV colors/settings to your specifications. Thesis a huge bonus for those of us who like to tweak the colors to our individual palette's, it just takes a bit of time and patience to adjust but once dialed-in, they are very nice.  
Also remember, the color / sound quality is only as good as the data being sent to the TV.

8/19/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this about a week ago and so far so good.  It is very easy to switch between live tv or one of your streaming services.  The picture is pretty good as well.  The only thing that is slightly annoying is the volume.  The volume changes depending on whether you are streaming or live tv, so you are turning volume up or down a lot when switching to streaming or live tv.",4 out of 5 stars review
9/17/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] GOT THIS TV AND XBOX ON SAME DAY AND THAT WAS A GOOD DAY. GREAT PICTURE WITH BRIGHT COLORS AND A GOOD REFRESH RATE TO ENHANCE A GAMING EXPERIENCE. DEFINITELY WILL BE LOOKING TO GO BIGGER WITH VIZIO AS SOON AS PAPER PERMITS. LOL,4 out of 5 stars review
10/8/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As noted in the title, very easy to setup and good picture quality. Only issue we've had is one of the cable boxes uses a coax cable and it doesn't always pick-up the default screen resolution and color so I have to unhook the coax then plug it in each time (weird but oh well).",4 out of 5 stars review
10/23/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Have a new V-Seiries that the display went to verticle lines throughout the screen. Vizio is replacing the unit which I am happy for.

7/8/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Did a bunch of research before I decided on a new T.V. and Vizio was the clear winner.  This t.v. still has those ancient aux/image/ L&R sound plugs so I can still play my N64 on this! And an input Button! I don't know why but I hate the fact that new t.v.s don't have this feature anymore.  Would definitely recommend over Roku. They have hundreds of app channels except for Spotify which just really doesn't make sense to me but I'll live.,4 out of 5 stars review
7/8/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this tv. I have recommended to customers In store while looking for one. I don’t like the new update to where I change my stations without it going straight to the guide. I like to flip to the next channel. It gets annoying having to go through the guide every time. I want to be able to have what’s on catch my interest.,4 out of 5 stars review
8/15/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Good all around smart TV. Great picture and has plenty of streaming apps. However, on some software updates the TV has to be reset because because it starts acting strangely. Strange things like suddenly shutting off, streaming content hangs, repeating streaming content and sound suddenly going mute. No problem resetting but you then have to re-login to all your apps.",4 out of 5 stars review
10/9/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The app section can be confusing at first but once you play around you will get a handle on it in no time.  other than that its a basic Smart TV that seems to have very little lag and good picture quality.  Perfect for any bedroom but I would upgrade to something nicer for any entertainment room but this would also work well in that area as well.,4 out of 5 stars review
10/7/2023,Very good TV for the price. I bought one for my daughter’s room and one for my mother-in-law. Very nice picture. The audio sound for the TV sounds terrible out of the box but if you go into the audio settings and turn I believe “auto balancing on” it will make the volume so much better. Just go through the audio settings until it’s how you like.,4 out of 5 stars review

10/18/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this TV after an untimely accident with our old one. This was easy to setup and has a decent picture.

7/20/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Had to correct the colors from the default values. Reds came out mostly orange on some platforms. Colors are a bit washed even after correction but not too terrible as I was able to mostly correct the image through the settings. Odd that the volume is only adjustable to even values from 0-100. Why not just have 50 values if they can only be set that way, regardless? When paired with the Vizio 5.1.2 soundbar the audio peaks above what the satellite speakers can handle. I’ve used worse television sets and this is not bad for the price.",4 out of 5 stars review
7/24/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought the 43 inch V-Series for our game room.  Specifically for my son's gaming console.  He has not had any complaints other than the brightness.  The TV viewing angle is not very good although I do notice some fading around the corners.  Sound is also very good and does not need a sound bar/  The apps work seamless without any issues.  I have also tried out the new Visio Mobile app with the beta  VIZIOgram.  App is ok and needs some work but overall, it's a great additional feature to have.  Please keep this as it will prove to be very useful and used.  Highly recommend VIZIO if on a budget.  It is truly a great VALUE!",4 out of 5 stars review
8/24/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is our 4th Vizio bought all of them are good been buying Vizio since it came out and haven't bought any other brand tv love the product but the speakers on 55"" could be better so I don't turn it up so high when trying to listen better.

9/27/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this TV back in July and started having issues with the volume and fast forwarding. You could press up in the volume once and it would keep going to full volume with no way to stop it. Same with Volume down. This also started happening with FF and RR. Called Vizio and they were quick to send a very knowledgeable tech to repair it. Hopefully will not have this issue any time soon, as I love this TV.",4 out of 5 stars review
6/29/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought my TV for my new apartment, to sit on top of a bookshelf/TV cabinet. The picture quality is incredible! The colors are clear and crisp. The built-in speaker sound quality is sometimes fuzzy, so I didn't rate it 5 stars. However, this issue may be unique to my set and not a bug in the product line. This is my third Vizio TV, I bought two 32"" models, one for a guest room and another as a housewarming gift for my son. 
The streaming apps loaded on the set cover every possible genre of entertainment. I especially like the free movie and TV show apps. Vizio will be my first choice when purchasing TVs in the future.",4 out of 5 stars review
8/2/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I actually had this TV for over a year now, and even though the remote went through a wash cycle, it still works (after replacing batteries and cleaning it up).

7/19/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have had this television for a little over a year now. I have not had many problems with it. Mainly bugs in the software updates. These could only be fixed by my perspective by restoring it to factory settings and re-updating. However, the picture and audio quality are on par for the current market. It comes pre installed with numerous popular streaming apps with a large variety of other per your discretion apps available in their app store. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase and quality of the product. Software updates appear to need work to me though.",4 out of 5 stars review
7/27/2023,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought this TV to mount in my office for general use. Mostly use it to watch YouTube and various streaming services. But the bonus and primary reason for buying this TV was for use with my PC as an extra monitor. Because it has 4:4:4 chroma sampling this makes it a perfect fit to use a monitor. Everything works as you would expect and does a decently good job doing it. The only complaint I would have is that the Vizio OS or the home screen can be a bit slow and unresponsive at times. Other than that I'd highly recommend this TV for the value.,4 out of 5 stars review
7/21/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love all of the features on this tv and VIZIO is a great brand, the only thing I would negatively say about it is that the sound quality isn’t the greatest. However, I know that it’s a smaller tv size and therefore its’ capabilities are limited in comparison to larger models.",4 out of 5 stars review
7/12/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The device seems to be great in regards to picture and sound quality. Packaging was well done, and the protective coverings were meant to stay on until removed.
I would suggest changing the default start up screen that notifies the user that a network is not available, not all people want their devices connected 24/7, and it is somewhat bothersome having to then search for the input that is normally used. I would prefer to start the device and instantly see the programming from whatever service I use, i.e. Dish or Comcast.
Functionality of the remote is good, but again, the start screen requires interaction using the device remote, versus the input device remote, such as Dish or Comcast....",4 out of 5 stars review
10/4/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So far so good, the only flaw or problem I have had is the TV speakers. Really low quality sound compared to other TV's I have had.

11/18/2022,"This is our 4th or 5th Visio. Have always been very happy with the brand. This brand has a frustrating feature that I can't change that when you turn it on, it starts on the ""home"" screen with all the apps instead of ones regular TV channel. Because of that, you have to use 2 remotes - Visio one to be able to switch to regular TV and ones local cable remote. Previous Visio TVs did not do that.",4 out of 5 stars review
8/23/2023,"While I DO love most things about this TV, there is one I do NOT. I don’t like the size of the font on the settings menu. I have Low-Vision which is why I need a 65” TV. And while the menu and home screen are ok, the settings menu means I stand right in front of the screen when I do need to go to that section. Sucks that I have a 65” but the actual settings is on a 3 sq” display (abt. Cause I’m a smart “mouth” like that). But otherwise I love this TV. I love the sound quality and the video quality is awesome as well. The smart features and the ease of use is great. But come on I know I’m not the only one who has a TV this big for other reasons besides just having a big  📺. So come on Vizio, don’t make a screen size so ginormous and then ha...",4 out of 5 stars review
9/21/2023,"Bought this TV for football, it does not disappoint on the picture clarity, super easy to setup as long as you have a smartphone. The interface is a bit laggy but is to be expected in this price range good enough for me. It remindes me of bluray players menus. The speakers is what is really lacking with this tv.

8/7/2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We’ve had this TV for almost 2 years now, and has great picture and sound. However, it sporadically won’t work for no reason, and many of the apps aren’t maintained well by the external developers. For example, Paramount TV+ doesn’t work properly at all, so we also had to get a Roku for those instances. I also love the Watch Free+ they provide, but again, they have issues like incorrect schedules on the guide or repeating commercials back-to-back sometimes up to 5 times in a row.
