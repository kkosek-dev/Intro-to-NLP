11/22/2023,"I ordered a Vizio 50"" Class V-Series 4L UHD LED TV on the Walmart Website on Nov 14th.  On Nov 16th I received a confirmation that the TV was delivered.  IT WAS NOT.  I have been battling with Walmart ever since.  It is false advertisement and BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE by Walmart when they do not stand by their products that they sell on their website.  Even if it is shipped by the third-party seller.  Walmart should HONOR the sell and ship a replacement item to the customer.  Walmart STILL has the item on thier website and will not ship me a replacement.  Walmart has partnered with the third party sell and should stand by Walmart's commitment to service the customer.

12/5/2023,"It didn't work right out of the box. Nothing but vertical and a few horizontal lines. Vizio said it was bad and needed to be replaced by Walmart said I can only return for refund even though they do have a replacement at the store close to me. They delivered it and I had friends set it up since I just had surgery so for me to take apart, rebox and take this 70 inch TV back to the store in my Prius is asking too much. Plus I'll have to deal with the installation of the replacement . Now I've seen people complain about how long it takes Walmart to process refunds and that also isn't fair.

It was never dropped, and this (see attachment) is what I found when I took off the cardboard protection. I never received an invoice for this product.

Driver shows up and says “ I dont see how they expect one guy to deliver this thing - come get it “.  To then notice the TV was hauled laid flat in a truck bed- big no no, says right on box in images to haul vertically ONLY. 
The resolution of the TV seems subpar to expectations.  Our old TCL TV we replaced with this one was about five years old and had a  much better picture.

Now, the second one has network connectivity issues even though my router is only 10 feet from the TV.  This happens about every 20-30 minutes, in the middle of whatever I'm watching, and won't reconnect for 5-10 minutes. No other device in my home has this issue, so I know it is not my wifi.

1/9/2024,"What can I say? This TV only lasted 13 months. Screen randomly went black yesterday. I had my old TV for 10 years and sold it for $50. It was still working great.

Decided to “upgrade” and this thing couldn't even make it 2 years. Vizio couldn't care less. They did nothing. Based on how long this product lasted and based on Vizio's response, I do not recommend you purchase Visio products. There's another company that makes quality products and their stand behind their products.

I will contact Walmart to see if there is anything they can do and I will update this review accordingly.",1 out of 5 stars review

Around  April 20, 2023 Vizio did a software update that made it almost impossible to watch my over-the-air channels with my slow and unreliable internet connection. I had to turn the wi-fi off to get them back. Even so, it's very slow to get a picture when I turn on the TV, and there's an annoying menu now too.

5/5/2023,"This is not a technical review of this television, more of a complaint. I'm hoping it will eventually turn out to be a good TV. But there is a major caveat that any potential buyer should be aware of.

The VOC odor of this TV is the strongest of any piece of electronics I've even encountered. As soon as I unpacked it, every one of my family members commented on the awful smell. Within a few minutes, two family members complained of headaches.

I moved it out to my garage. I kept the garage door open during the day to help with the ventilation. The last two days, I've brought it out to my patio in hopes that the sun plus the outdoor breeze would help accelerate the off-gassing. It has not helped.

Purchased and right out of the box the Apple Airplay %26 screen mirror wouldn't work.  Spent about an hour trouble shooting on our own and over 1 1/2 hours on phone with Vizio support.  The firmware was not updated, so all the features do not work, and the TV would not manually update the firmware by factory reset, manual update or via a process that was a pain using a thumb drive.

4/8/2022,"If you really want to waist your hard earned money then this is the TV for you. You'll be very pleased to know that in just two short years the LEDs burn out. If you're dumb like me You'll try to fix it yourself.  You'll purchase an led kit ""not cheap"" by the way,  only to find that they've sealed the screen so that it cracks before you can remove it.
I will never purchase another Visio product. Not even accidentally. 
I'm telling you that I never complain about anything but after paying the better part of a thousand dollars for this thing I expected it to last longer than two years.
Thanks for nothing Visio.

12/8/2021,"I generally do not submit reviews but I felt compelled to do so now.  I have come to realize that I should have read all of the negative reviews.  Although I understand that some comments you have to take some with a grain of salt.  The TV looked amazing at the time of set up with vibrant colors.  Once it was set up the colors no so! The TV is dark, no matter how I changed the settings with and without Vizio's assistance. Some colors are fine but all faces have a tint of orange or looks like a really bad self tanning lotion mishap. Another big issue is IT STINKS! It smells like burning plastic. I thought it was the packaging/plastic it was sent in but it is in fact the TV. You can smell it (TV on or off) as soon as you walk into my house.  ...",1 out of 5 stars review
4/9/2022,"I read the reviews and had high expectations with this TV but the picture is not like you're in a movie theater and definitely not the sound. The sound is awful, you have to turn it up so high just to hear it. You'll definitely need a sound bar. I bought this TV to replace my 50” Emerson that I've had for years but the Emerson is better than the Vizio. To top it off just 2 days after I began using the Vizio , it has lines coming down from the top of the screen! What is this!! I definitely want my money back!",1 out of 5 stars review

Got the tv home and on the stand for my wife to do the initial start up (not my thing) for her to tell me it wasn't allowing any of the apps like Netflix, Amazon and all the others to watch any programs.

9/4/2022,Have had this television for about 5 months.  In that time I have come to despise vizio products.  The on screen menu system is slow to react - yes I've done the 'factory reset' and it doesn't fix anything.  The worst part is the television is now essentially bricked after a firmware update.

I have super fast high speed internet and several smart TVs along with other devices that are connected to it and none of my other devices were lagging. Next the tv would freeze and we had to complete reset it to get it to start backing working but not without the lag of course.

Visio used to be good stuff, but not any longer.  I bought a replacement that was bad for other reasons... $600 and two pieces of garbage.

10/3/2022,"Had previous positive experience with Vizio but this tv is crap. You think all is fine until one day where you've been streaming shows then go to watch something else and it won't work. Looked up the issue and others have the same problem. 

To fix you have to turn the tv off, unplug, hold power button for 5-10 seconds, plug tv back up, turn tv on and you can resume streaming until you can't. May have to repeat the process. It's infuriating and regret purchasing this product. If you have another option go with it and stay away from this tv.",1 out of 5 stars review

11/5/2023,"This TV worked great for almost exactly 2 months and then died. Since this occurred over the 30 day limit of Walmart's return policy for electronic items, my only option was to contact the manufacturer. 

They told me they would replace the TV but wanted me to supply them with a credit card number in order to place a hold on the card for the amount of the purchase price, $238,  and I would need to send the broken TV back to them. They would release the hold after they received the TV.   

Although this might be legitimate, it just seemed a little scammy to me. Why not let me just take it back to Walmart?  What do they do with broken TV's?  Reuse the parts?

My phone was easily hacked by connecting my phone to thee tvs in my house when we had someone possibly sneaking in, and they were able to completely all my personal and work information while in my own home, spying on me. This I'd also say, did have to do with security through wifi, Bluetooth and the cellular device itself. Still, the TV was a piece of the problem. Please help!!",1 out of 5 stars review
11/25/2023,Was a great TV but they've just released a firmware update that throws all that out the window. It's the update where they moved the input and volume display to the upper right and turned it orange. So dumb. Everytime you turn on the TV it forces you to their ads page instead of returning you to the input you had it on. If you use Alexa integration you can no longer tell her to pause. There is no way to disable auto updates so good luck.,1 out of 5 stars review
