11/28/2023,"My last Vizio tv was a 37 inch I think. It was almost 20 years old and still working good. I decided on an upgrade. The price of flatscreens has come down over the years and you can buy a much larger screen with more features for less money than 20 years ago. This 50 inch is a smart 4K with chromecast built in. It was $248 which is about $200 less than what I paid for the 37 inch.
I have streaming apps on my phone and iPad and I can select a movie and start it on my tv. Also have the same apps on the tv but I think being able to do it with my phone or iPad is easier and faster.
I could have gone bigger but I think this is plenty big. When I was younger we had a 13 inch BW tv and no cable. 
I think anyone would be happy with this tv",5 out of 5 stars review
11/27/2023,"I purchased the 65‚Äù Vizio 4K TV In part on the strength of good reviews but a sale price of just under $400 pushed me over the edge. I use a Firestick most of the time so I didn't care too much about the TV's build in OS, but I found that it's actually pretty decent and offers a nice array of alternative content. 

I replaced a 48 inch 1080p LG and the difference is remarkable. I would definitely buy another one.",5 out of 5 stars review
9/26/2023,This Vizio 4K UHD is easy to setup may take some time updating as you get connected with internet. I would recommend this beauty too anyone and everyone who enjoys a quality product with clear high definition and quality image. So amazed at how great this quality flat screen is for the fair price.,5 out of 5 stars review
9/8/2023,"Love the size, the clarity and the sound‚Ä¶..amazing!! Make sure your current tv stand is large enough for this to sit on top of, had to purchase a new one for this set. Plenty of apps (but not abc) to enjoy hours of entertainment, minimalist remote control and after purchasing (hopefully you catch it on sale) you can enter a sweepstakes for a Vizio sound bar which in my opinion isn't necessary because the sound is robust as is but who's turning down the opportunity for a free useful electronic üòè",5 out of 5 stars review
9/10/2023,"Great TV, picture is great, not a fan of the legs, not as sturdy as I like, this was an upgrade in size from a 43‚Äô Vizio D, to a 50‚Äô Vizio V, crisp, clear picture. To solve the leg issue, I bought on Amazon a center TV stand. I‚Äôm sure once I have it put on, I‚Äôll feel better.",5 out of 5 stars review
7/9/2023,"Really outstanding performance, I've had one other Vizio in my life and it's probably 10 years old and still performs great. I basically use m Vizio for Gaming on my PS5 or watching football. So far I have no complaints at all, would highly recommend",5 out of 5 stars review
10/11/2023,Great picture love different settings we like the vivid picture setting. we also like the fact that the soundbar sounds great too. normal sound is good too weight is good also setup was a breeze make sure you download the app first thing also adding my other accounts is easy too very happy and will buy again if ever need one.,5 out of 5 stars review
11/16/2023,"TV is very sturdy. It has some weight to it, but rather easy to mount. Graphics are above what I expected for its prize. The VIZIO user interface looks a lot better than most other TVs and is put together quite well. The TV is very responsive to remote commands and inputs. I don't find myself using the microphone commands on the remote, but it capable. Definitely a great deal and worth the purchase.",5 out of 5 stars review
11/5/2023,I liked the updates and the map showing where the driver was. It gave me a sense of how close they were to actually delivering. The Walmart app also showed the expected time of delivery and how many deliveries the driver had before me. This was our first time having something delivered from the store. A picture was taken and sent to us in the app saying it was delivered but they meet us at the door to make sure we received the item in hand.,5 out of 5 stars review

1/14/2024,"This 50in Vizio smart tv is a great choice if you're looking for a new smart tv.The picture is beautiful and the operating system is smooth and easy to navigate even for a person that isn't familiar with smart televisions.I ordered it on a Thursday and received it on Friday before 1pm,very fast and it is easy to setup. The only thing I suggest is to setup a soundbar if you're planning on watching movies, sports etc,that really is normal with mostly all smart tvs as they aren't great with volume issues.It arrived in perfect condition. I would definitely recommend this tv for the price point.",5 out of 5 stars review

11/18/2023,What sold me on this tv was the Bluetooth headphones connection compatibility. I am a super early riser in the mornings. I love being able to put my AirPods in and watch tv with out disturbing my husband. The voice control remote is awesome to take you right to the app you want to stream on. So happy with my purchase. I‚Äôve had it for 2 weeks so far with zero issues. The sound isn‚Äôt as loud as my old tv so I am thinking of purchasing a sound bar for it. Not an issue for me though. Still over the moon with this tv!,5 out of 5 stars review
11/12/2023,If you're looking for a great quality easy setup picture and sound perfect tv that doesn't break your pocket This Vizio is the one ! We replaced it from our last one which lasted us many long years. Our relatives %26 friends have other well name brands that haven't held up like this brand . Honestly I never take time nor honestly have time to leave reviews however I feel this will help others who are struggling to find a good tv. For them or as a gift,5 out of 5 stars review
1/26/2024,"With 4K resolution, it really stands out if you want to make a statement in any room. One of the best features for me was that they included Bluetooth connectivity to any headphones, so if you wanna blast that movie at night by all means. It also syncs with your PS5 and your fire stick TV so you don‚Äôt need so one remote.",5 out of 5 stars review
5/17/2021,"Good size at 55 inches and easy set up, it walks you through everything.
It has tons of free show, movies, etc and apps. It also has it's own free
Tv app that has tons of stuff too. Really easy to navigate anywhere with
in the tv and all the options it has. Remote control is sleek and very easy
to use. I love the voice search. It's so easy. I like that at top of remote
it has Tubi, crackle, Netflix and 3 others, but wish one was programmable
to the app I use most instead of what they preselected. The tv is really
very nice and has vivid, clean and beautiful color on all pictures. Volume
is good but muted do to speakers being in the back of tv instead of
on sides or front, because it's mounted on my wall the volume isn't
as loud as...",5 out of 5 stars review
5/4/2021,"This is the first 4k TV I have ever owned and wow, what a difference!! The 4k streaming is incredible. The colors are super vibrant and it really feels like you are in the show. I was in complete awe watching a nature show. The rest of the TV is just as impressive. The box has simple instructions on it for set up and installation plus there are instructions inside. Setting up was a breeze. The home page has all the most popular apps already pre-installed and all you have to do is log in. Connecting to wifi was quick and easy as well. My home wifi immediately popped up on the scan list and I was connected in less than a minute. The connection was fast!

What a gift this would be for a wedding, housewarming, or just an upgrade. You will not be disappointed.",5 out of 5 stars review
5/7/2021,"This is not a TV, it is an experience. I have another major brand that is two years old and the difference in the picture quality and features from it to this TV is no less than amazing. We don't have reliable internet in our rural area so I can't use the smart cast or other features. I connect it to DIRECTV and the features are fantastic. The colors and detail are unbelievable. It is not easy to connect and program but once it is up and going it is worth the effort. The sound could be better, I have it connected to a sound bar so that is not a problem. I use closed captioning most of the time and due to the size of the viewing area the captioning is not so distracting to other viewers. I would also like to see several more USB and HDML out...",5 out of 5 stars review

I was able to walk through the set up steps quickly and with ease. Nothing too complicated for set up which was super nice. 

The quality of the TV and what if offers is simply amazing. My previous TV wasn't that old (less than five years) but WOW the upgrade is so worth it!

From my favorite crime shows, live news channels, cooking shows, workout videos, sitcoms, etc. If you can imagine it, it is there. I played with this for over an hour and probably didn't even get through a small fraction of the items on this TV set.

It is 4K Ultra HD which makes a huge difference on the sharpness and the sound quality is actually much better than I expected. It is incredible how much the 55"" size makes a difference in everyone's enjoyment of the programs we watch! Visio has something called SmartCast that enables quick access to many common services like Roku, Netflix, Disney+, and it also has AirPlay and Chromcast built in. Because services like these are integrated, setting it up was a breeze and there was no need to attach accessories like a Roku stick, saving a little money. Like many electronics, there is a Quick Start Guide and no user manual so prepare to access that online if needed, however the most ...",5 out of 5 stars review

It supports Dolby Vision and HDR10, with AMD Freesync as well. The low latency makes it greay for gaming. I'd definitely recommend this TV. I've used it over a year now and have no complaints. The Vizio interface took a little getting used to switching from Roku. I'd recommend this TV to anyone looking for a great gaming TV.",5 out of 5 stars review

Never did I think that the picture could or would be so vivid and crisp. The live image is better than on the ad. A lot better. The sound is immersive and intense. 
Set-up is straight forward. I think it took less than an hour from start to finish.  I‚Äôm only using WiFi and have tons of channels. 
The remote is simple and actually unnecessary. You can download an app to your phone to do everything you want or need. Either way, you can access voice remote and end hunting for shows once and for all.

It was quite an undertaking to set it up and go through the registration for youtube, youtube tv and Prime again, but Everything went without a hitch.  Pure luxury for me and highly recommended.

1/19/2024,"I am very pleased with my new 65‚Äù Vizio TV. It was easy to unpack and set up.  It was nice to have an ‚Äúextra set of hands‚Äù because the size of the TV makes it a bit cumbersome (not heavy-just awkward).  This is my 3rd Vizio TV.  I used to be a fan of Samsung TVs but I find Vizio makes at least as good a TV but often priced for less.  In fact, I was stunned by the $398 price for this set. I mean this is a 65 inch Ultra High Definition set capable of 4k.  It seems I see similar TVs by other manufacturers for $1,000 or higher at other stores. 
It has a great picture, nice remote and connected nicely to a Vizio sound bar I also bought. It connected very easily to our WiFi and recognized the other Vizio system in the house.",5 out of 5 stars review

1/21/2024,"My 47"" VISIO of 13 yrs just would not die,.. But I finally got the go ahead and upgrade anyway to this 55"" .  It has the ARC I wanted to seamlessly work with sound bar using ARC. Love everything about this TV so I will list minor downside. Did not come with printed manual which I like to have in front of me when setting up.  I found everything I wanted through trial and error. Only other downside for me is that it does not have option to choose a different screen size for a given input as my last one did. My older DVR requires that the screen be stretched. Also remote does not have ""previous"" button or ""number digits"" so for a few bucks bought another remote on Amz that does have those. So one remote for me and one for my wife. win win.",5 out of 5 stars review

I have a medium speed connection and it consumed 3 gigabytes of data and I only get 50 gigs of data per month. Because it consumed so much bandwidth I will likely be without high speed internet for the last few days of the billing period. This is not Walmart's fault.

people mention the tv being super quiet.  It was for me out of the box, but then I tinkered with the sound settings and had it auto-balance the sound, and it was fine after that.  (I am hard of hearing as well...).

If i had one thing I wish i could change, it would be the home screen, because I really dont like all the extra ""view this or try this"" stuff on the menus, and would like to have all my preferred menus first...but the fact I can arrange the menus I do use so that my most common apps are in an order i prefer them is enough to make...",5 out of 5 stars review

Being able to purchase a 65"" television from a well known manufacturer with a strong history in making quality electronics for a long time, is unheard of.  If you set proper expectations with what the television is going to offer then you will be very happy with this purchase.  This TV is not going to have the dynamic crystal clear pictures, it will not have a lot of custimation settings, and backlighting issues can be noticeable at times.

It has more apps, then most, the price was right, and; it comes with Redbox App, which it definitely a huge benefit, via; most Smart TVs don't come with that app and free live TV (WITH MORE TV PROGRAM OPTIONS)....",5 out of 5 stars review

10/5/2023,I bought this tv in a 75 in for myself last year. I went to my parents house and their tv was so small I couldn't see over the wood burning stove so I bought them this tv in a 65in. Now they have a big tv in their living room everyone can see when they come to visit,5 out of 5 stars review
7/8/2023,I am sooo happy with this tv!!!! Came on time %26 in perfectly great condition packed very safe. This was so easy to set up ! I am so not into technology at all so I was afraid to get a smart tv.  My son started up it took less than 8 minutes for all the scanning or searches and it automatically recognized our WiFi. I don't see great I wear glasses and being able to say Netflix or prime or Hulu is great. Didn't need to do anything for the voice remote to work. Only improvement would be for the remote to light up but that's not a big deal. The tv is so so nice for 317.00 with tax this 55 inch looks bigger than it is idk if it's bcuz it's in my room but everyone of my kids and grandson thought it was big and my grandsons room has a 70 inch ! ...,5 out of 5 stars review

10/4/2023,"This is a two part review as the product itself was a great quality and we've been really happy upgrading to all Vizios in our home. I do want to say though that the Walmart employees who delivered it, they didn't just knock on the door and drop it. They walked it in the house and placed it in the living room and I send them out with a thank you tip and waters. Could not say how much I appreciated it being a mom at home by myself and having to consider getting that tv up the front steps. Big appreciate for going above and beyond.",5 out of 5 stars review
9/15/2023,"The 65"" Smart TV from Vizio is a great item. The picture, speed of actions, price, and being lightweight (wall-mounted) are definitely a plus. My only concern is the smaller size of the remote. Yes, It is a bit slight and because of that it is actually a cumbersome remote to operate. 
The sound is good for a flat-screen TV, however, I ordered the Vizio surround sound system and the sound has intensified the listening enjoyment. I would recommend this product.",5 out of 5 stars review
8/18/2023,"I know there are numerous tv brands to choose from that are equally good as the Vizio. However, I've bought and trust the Vizio brand for over 20 years. I have never encountered any issues. The features are fantastic. This tv purchase is actually replacing my older model 65"" Vizio that I've had for over 13 years. No issues with the older model. I'm actually paying it forward and giving it to a friend. She's overjoyed to receive it.",5 out of 5 stars review

3/29/2023,Love the interface of this TV! The only thing I was missing was how to add additional apps. Couldn't figure it out if it is an option. I ended up buying a Roku stick to add for my other network apps that aren't included. This is so much more user friendly than Samsung in my opinion.  Great color and clarity.,5 out of 5 stars review

9/18/2023,Was wanting an inexpensive larger screen television. Looked at the Hisense and the Vizio.  Can't address the longevity since I just got it but the quality build and ease of setup put Vizio Head and Shoulders above the hisense. The Hisense legs were plastic that just attached on the outside of the back. The Vizio legs are metal and actually slide up inside the frame of the TV and attach.  To start the Vizio all I had to do was plug in the Amazon Fire stick it automatically connected with our Wi-Fi and within 60 seconds I was ready to watch. The Hisense Roku wanted me to set up a Roku account and jump to a lot of hoops before I could watch TV.  The picture on the Vizio is fantastic and for the extra $20 it was well worth getting the Vizio.,5 out of 5 stars review
8/6/2023,"It‚Äôs a fine TV. Would be fantastic if it had 120Hz refresh rate, but can‚Äôt expect that on a TV at this price point. If you‚Äôre a casual TV watcher or like to do basic console gaming, this TV is a great choice. Price seems very reasonable. Picture clarity out of the box is great and the sound from the speakers seems fine.

Easy onscreen set up as with prior models. Only had it a short while, so time will tell.  For what its worth, gave the 24"" to a neighbor kid who didn't have one.

5/14/2023,"Walmart‚Äôs price was great, and the delivery was right on time!  My only negative is with Vizio, not Walmart.  I‚Äôm old-school and rely on manuals and schematics.  Setting this up was difficult as it is NOT just attach cables, and it‚Äôs ready to go.  No explanation of how to get TV channels after the screen tells you that you have no signal.  Online chat walked me through how to get to ‚Äúadd more channels‚Äù to get anything to appear!  Honestly, VIZIO, change me $10 more and include a set-up guide with pictures!",5 out of 5 stars review
