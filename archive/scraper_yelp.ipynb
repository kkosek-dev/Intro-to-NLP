This is basically South End still so you can't really ever have too many such places.<br/><br/>For a bottle shop it's actually quite large. It definitely has more of a bar feel. Naturally, there's a ton offered on tap in addition to the many bottles. Several TVs to watch the game(s). Light on the bathrooms - only 3 individual ones. As the name suggests, there are actually a couple of bulldogs in here. I feel kinda bad for the guys though because they're caged up in a loud environment. They've basically become desensitized to people too.<br/><br/>Prices are about what you've come to expect. Unless you find street parking you should plan to walk a bit to get here.

Not only do I come here quite often but it is right next to my apartment! I have long been a fan of this casual hangout. It is a small place that feels like you are hanging out in a friend's garage. They have a free pool table, dart boards, and a personal favorite golden tee. They keep a rotating selection of beers on tap and have recently introduced liquor as well which means they had to become a club. It is only $1.00 to get started and you can just add it to your tab, after that you simply have to put your phone number in each time you come, it is quick and easy! Also if you are looking to pick up a bottle of wine or a case of beer and you can grab some out of the fridge and they will ring you out to go. If you are looking for a laid back atmosphere to have a few drinks with friends then this is the spot for you. Also there is a popcorn machine in the back corner!</span></p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"comment__09f24__D0cxf css-qgunke\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">Let me start off by saying that I was illegally and fraudulently charged at Bulldog. This <br/><br/>is my first ever review on yelp. So I'm not some crazy person who leaves bad reviews on every time there is bad service. <br/><br/>This was my first time to Bulldog's and it will be my last. We walk in, cool vibe, playing darts, I go to get a drink, there are 2 bartenders. One was really nice and I got 1 drink (my first drink of the night, to clarify I was NOT wasted). I went to get a second beer and the other bartender would NOT take my order. She wouldn't even look me in the eye. At one point I was the only person at the bar trying to get a drink and she just walked away and started to talk to some guys at the end of the bar... cool. So I walked away to see if I could get the other bartenders attention. A group of girls approached me and said \"yea don't even try to get a drink from that one, she refuses to serve females. I don't know what her problem is.\" Ok got it.<br/><br/>I went back up to the bar and after a solid couple of minutes I got her attention. I did not act frustrated or upset, I just simply asked for an East Ciders Original. She then took another guys order and I specificity heard him say it was a Wicked Weed Pernicsomthing or other because I thought it was a weird name. Clearly I'm not a beer girl.<br/><br/>She came back with his beer and not mine. Ok, weird. He was holding out his card to give to her and she grabs my card and his card and goes to get my cider. She comes back with my cider and then swipes my card and asks if I want to close out and I said yes. She then proceeds to give his blue Chase card back to him. Then hands me my card with the receipt. The guy asks \"do I need to sign anything\" and her response was \"no don't worry about it.\" Ok.<br/><br/>I look down at my bill and it has both his beer and my cider on the bill. I nicely confronted her about it and said \"I saw what you just did there and that is not cool. Can i please speak with your manager?\" she said \"I am the manager.\" Yea ok.... So I ask \"Ok well can I have the information of who owns this place?\" she said, \"I own it.\" ...... ok you're lying but that is fine. I didn't cause a scene because it isn't worth it right?<br/><br/>I told her I wanted a refund and she said \"I will refund you but you still need to pay for your cider.\" I told her \"listen, I work in customer service and I literally just watched you WILLINGLY put someone elses drink on my card. On purpose. 100%. I do not want 2 charges from this facility because I do not trust that you will cancel the first payment.\" She wouldn't let it go...<br/><br/>I said fine. It is what it is. I just paid for both beers, left and vowed not to come back. <br/><br/>I am writing this because I took a look at my bank statements and it looks like little miss bartender decided to give herself a $20 tip! So instead of my bill being like $12, it's $32! Again, 100% knowing it was wrong and ILLEGAL she stole more of my money.<br/><br/>That's totally fine. Take my money girl, I truly don't care. I just want everyone who decides to come to Bulldog to please monitor your charges and be mindful (especially if you've been drinking) of your bill at the end of the night as well as the bank statement in the following days when they are closed out.<br/><br/>I still have my receipt from that night.</span></p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"comment__09f24__D0cxf css-qgunke\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\" lang=\"en\">I'm officially adding Bulldog to my list of favorite taprooms in Southend! So much beer, so little time!<br/><br/>This is a good place to hang out and actually talk with friends - not so loud that you can't hear the people you're talking with!<br/><br/>Twenty plus taps with a really nice diverse selection - a little something for everyone.<br/>Dart boards! Large tap room with Whiskey Barrel tables!<br/><br/>It's pretty laid back in here - like Brad mentioned it feels like a man cave/converted garage.<br/><br/>For me the parking lot wasn't that bad to navigate, but the spots are a little on the \"tight\" side.<br/><br/>There's a retail section with cold and non-refrigerated beer to go. Tonya P would give this place her stamp of approval as they sell bottles of bubbly!<br/><br/>A very short walk from Wooden Robot and Brass Tap. Add this place to your \"to do\" list.</span></p>,\n",

From the adorable bull dogs that greet you when you walk in the door (yes, that's right, bulldogs are IN the house!) to the pleasant bar tenders who are inviting and let you sample all their brews, to the great prices and excellent selection. Whether you're in the mood to play some darts, grab a six pack (or growler) to go or drink one their, Bulldog offers up a dark but local vibe, small patio and lots of standing room (with a mix of high top tables and bar seats). This is a place where the staff will remember your name and you'll want to return to. Cheers to drinking a pint of beer at Bulldog!</span></p>]"

Also if you are looking to pick up a bottle of wine or a case of beer and you can grab some out of the fridge and they will ring you out to go. If you are looking for a laid back atmosphere to have a few drinks with friends then this is the spot for you. Also there is a popcorn machine in the back corner!\",\n",
       " 'Let me start off by saying that I was illegally and fraudulently charged at Bulldog. This is my first ever review on yelp. So I\\'m not some crazy person who leaves bad reviews on every time there is bad service. This was my first time to Bulldog\\'s and it will be my last. We walk in, cool vibe, playing darts, I go to get a drink, there are 2 bartenders. One was really nice and I got 1 drink (my first drink of the night, to clarify I was NOT wasted). I went to get a second beer and the other bartender would NOT take my order. She wouldn\\'t even look me in the eye. At one point I was the only person at the bar trying to get a drink and she just walked away and started to talk to some guys at the end of the bar... cool. So I walked away to see if I could get the other bartenders attention. A group of girls approached me and said \"yea don\\'t even try to get a drink from that one, she refuses to serve females. I don\\'t know what her problem is.\" Ok got it.I went back up to the bar and after a solid couple of minutes I got her attention. I did not act frustrated or upset, I just simply asked for an East Ciders Original. She then took another guys order and I specificity heard him say it was a Wicked Weed Pernicsomthing or other because I thought it was a weird name. Clearly I\\'m not a beer girl.She came back with his beer and not mine. Ok, weird. He was holding out his card to give to her and she grabs my card and his card and goes to get my cider. She comes back with my cider and then swipes my card and asks if I want to close out and I said yes. She then proceeds to give his blue Chase card back to him. Then hands me my card with the receipt. The guy asks \"do I need to sign anything\" and her response was \"no don\\'t worry about it.\" Ok.I look down at my bill and it has both his beer and my cider on the bill. I nicely confronted her about it and said \"I saw what you just did there and that is not cool. Can i please speak with your manager?\" she said \"I am the manager.\" Yea ok.... So I ask \"Ok well can I have the information of who owns this place?\" she said, \"I own it.\" ...... ok you\\'re lying but that is fine. I didn\\'t cause a scene because it isn\\'t worth it right?I told her I wanted a refund and she said \"I will refund you but you still need to pay for your cider.\" I told her \"listen, I work in customer service and I literally just watched you WILLINGLY put someone elses drink on my card. On purpose. 100%. I do not want 2 charges from this facility because I do not trust that you will cancel the first payment.\" She wouldn\\'t let it go...I said fine. It is what it is. I just paid for both beers, left and vowed not to come back. I am writing this because I took a look at my bank statements and it looks like little miss bartender decided to give herself a $20 tip! So instead of my bill being like $12, it\\'s $32! Again, 100% knowing it was wrong and ILLEGAL she stole more of my money.That\\'s totally fine. Take my money girl, I truly don\\'t care. I just want everyone who decides to come to Bulldog to please monitor your charges and be mindful (especially if you\\'ve been drinking) of your bill at the end of the night as well as the bank statement in the following days when they are closed out.I still have my receipt from that night.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m officially adding Bulldog to my list of favorite taprooms in Southend! So much beer, so little time!This is a good place to hang out and actually talk with friends - not so loud that you can\\'t hear the people you\\'re talking with!Twenty plus taps with a really nice diverse selection - a little something for everyone.Dart boards! Large tap room with Whiskey Barrel tables!It\\'s pretty laid back in here - like Brad mentioned it feels like a man cave/converted garage.For me the parking lot wasn\\'t that bad to navigate, but the spots are a little on the \"tight\" side.There\\'s a retail section with cold and non-refrigerated beer to go. Tonya P would give this place her stamp of approval as they sell bottles of bubbly!A very short walk from Wooden Robot and Brass Tap. Add this place to your \"to do\" list.',\n",
       " \"I'm loving everything about Bulldog Beer & Wine! From the adorable bull dogs that greet you when you walk in the door (yes, that's right, bulldogs are IN the house!) to the pleasant bar tenders who are inviting and let you sample all their brews, to the great prices and excellent selection. Whether you're in the mood to play some darts, grab a six pack (or growler) to go or drink one their, Bulldog offers up a dark but local vibe, small patio and lots of standing room (with a mix of high top tables and bar seats). This is a place where the staff will remember your name and you'll want to return to. Cheers to drinking a pint of beer at Bulldog!\"]"
